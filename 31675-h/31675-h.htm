<h2><!-- page 1--><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
1</span>I.&mdash;Its Name and Its Antiquity</h2>
<p>Willenhall, vulgo Willnal, is undoubtedly a place of great
antiquity; on the evidence of its name it manifestly had its
foundation in an early Saxon settlement.&nbsp; The Anglo-Saxon
form of the name Willanhale may be interpreted as &ldquo;the
meadow land of Willa&rdquo;&mdash;Willa being a personal name,
probably that of the tribal leader, the head of a Teutonic
family, who settled here.&nbsp; In the Domesday Book the name
appears as Winehala, but by the twelfth century had approached as
near to its modern form as Willenhal and Willenhale.</p>
<p>Dr. Oliver, in his History of Wolverhampton, derives the name
from Velen, the Sun-god, and the Rev. H. Barber, of
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, who tries to find a Danish origin for nearly
all our old Midland place-names, suggests the Norse form
Vil-hjalmr; or perhaps a connection with Scandinavian family
names such as Willing and Wlmer.</p>
<p>Dr. Barber fortifies himself by quoting Scott:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Beneath the shade the Northmen came,<br />
Fixed on each vale a Runic name.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Rokeby, Canto, IV.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it may not be out of place to mention that Scandinavian
influences are occasionally traceable throughout the entire basin
of the Trent, even as far as this upper valley of its feeder, the
Tame.&nbsp; The place-name Bustleholme (containing the
unmistakable Norse root, &ldquo;holme,&rdquo; indicating a river
island) is the appellation of an ancient mill on this stream,
just below Wednesbury.&nbsp; In this connection it is interesting
to recall Carlyle&rsquo;s words.&nbsp; In his &ldquo;Hero
Worship,&rdquo; the sage informs us of a mode of speech still
used by the barge men of the Trent when the river is in a highly
flooded state, and running swiftly with a dangerous eddying
swirl.&nbsp; <!-- page 2--><a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The boatmen at such times will call
out to each other, &ldquo;Have a care! there is the Eager
coming!&rdquo;&nbsp; This, says Carlyle, is a relic of Norse
mythology, coming down to us from the time when pagan boatmen on
the Trent believed in that Northern deity, Aegir, the God of the
Sea Tempest, whose name (as he picturesquely puts it)
&ldquo;survives like the peak of a submerged world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This by the way.</p>
<p>Willenhall, however, was situated outside the Danelagh, the
western boundary of which was the Watling Street; indeed, the
place nomenclature of this locality affords very few examples
which are really traceable to the Danish occupation&mdash;an
almost solitary specimen being the aforementioned name of
Bustleholme, near the Delves.</p>
<p>The etymological derivation which has found most favour in
times past is that based on the erroneous Domesday form,
Winehala.&nbsp; Perhaps Stebbing Shaw is responsible for this, as
in his history of the county, written 1798, he
says:&mdash;&ldquo;As Wednesbury is but two miles, and
Wednesfield but one mile from hence, it is probable that this
name might be changed for that of Winehale, from the Saxon word
for victory, when that great battle was fought hereabout in
911.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this battle, and the victory or &ldquo;win&rdquo; which the
founding of Willenhall was supposed to commemorate, some account
will be given in the next chapter.&nbsp; But the hypothesis of
Shaw, and those who adopted his view, apparently involved the
supposition that the earliest mention of Willenhall was of a date
subsequent to 911 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>; but thanks to
the recent researches of our eminent local historiographer, Mr.
W. H. Duignan, F.S.A. (of Walsall), that position is no longer
tenable.</p>
<p>There is in existence a couple of charters dated <span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 732 (or 733; certainly before the year
734) which were executed by Ethelbald, King of Mercia, at a place
named therein as &ldquo;Willanhalch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Duignan says the Mercian kings frequently reside in this
part of their dominions, as at Kingsbury, Tamworth, and
Penkridge; probably for the convenience of hunting in Cannock
<!-- page 3--><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Forest, within the boundaries of which Willenhall was
anciently located.</p>
<p>Virtually the two charters are one, the same transaction being
recorded by careful and punctilious scribes in duplicate; and
their purport was to benefit Mildrith, now commonly called St.
Mildreda, one of the grand-daughters of King Penda, and probably
one of the few canonised worthies who can be claimed as natives
of this county-area.&nbsp; She was the Abbess of Minstrey, in the
Isle of Thanet, and &ldquo;sinful Ethelbald,&rdquo; as he humbly
styles himself, remits certain taxes and makes certain grants to
her newly-founded abbey, all for the good of his soul.&nbsp;
These duplicated documents were published in the original Latin
in Kemble&rsquo;s &ldquo;Codex Diplomaticus&rdquo; in 1843, by
Thorpe in his &ldquo;Diplomatarium Anglicum&rdquo; in 1865, and
again in Birch&rsquo;s &ldquo;Chartularium Saxonicum&rdquo; in
1885.</p>
<p>The internal evidence contained in them is to this
effect:&mdash;&ldquo;This was executed on the 4th day of the
Kalends of November, in the 22nd year of my reign, being the
fifteenth decree made in that place which is called
Willanhalch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not one of these three authorities,
although in the habit of doing so wherever they can offer an
opinion with any reasonable degree of certainty, has ventured to
suggest the modern name and identity of the &ldquo;place called
Willanhalch.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Duignan, with the ripe
knowledge and almost unerring judgment he possesses in such
matters, has no hesitation whatever in identifying the place as
Willenhall.&nbsp; As he says, there is no other place-name in
Mercia, or even in England, which could possibly be represented
by Willanhalch.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly there is another Willenhall.&nbsp; It is a hamlet
in the parish of Holy Trinity, Coventry, and its name was
anciently spelt Wylnhale.&nbsp; But the history of the place is
naturally involved in that of the city of Coventry, as the hamlet
never had any separate and independent existence like that of our
Staffordshire township.&nbsp; Any charter emanating from this
place would indubitably be dated &ldquo;Coventry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The suggestion of Shaw that the name was changed cannot be
entertained for one moment; the Anglo-Saxons were not in the <!--
page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>habit of changing place-names, but they were very much
addicted to the practice of &ldquo;calling their lands after
their own names.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Willmore, in his &ldquo;History
of Walsall&rdquo; (p. 30) adopts the now discarded derivation of
the name of Willenhall.&nbsp; He says &ldquo;After the defeat a
great feast of rejoicing was held by the Saxons at Winehala, the
Hall of Victory, and the event was long celebrated by the
national poets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To identify the &ldquo;Hall of Victory&rdquo; with Willenhall
the Walsall historian proceeds:&mdash;&ldquo;At Lowhill may still
be seen the remains of a large tumulus, while in Wrottesley Park
are the vestiges of a large encampment, believed by some
authorities to be of Danish construction, and to have been
occupied by them about the time of these engagements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet in the next paragraph it is admitted that the Danes never
gained a permanent footing in this locality, and that there is
scarce a name of purely Danish origin in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willenhalch,&rdquo; then, may be accepted as signifying
in Anglo-Saxon &ldquo;the meadowland of Willan,&rdquo; Willan
(not Willen) being a personal name, and halch being a form of
healh, signifying &ldquo;enclosed land on the banks of a
stream,&rdquo; as, for instance, on the Willenhall Brook.</p>
<p>Any ancient place-name terminating in &ldquo;halch&rdquo;
would, in the course of time, terminate in &ldquo;hall,&rdquo; a
termination now commonly construed as &ldquo;hall,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;mansion.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is nothing inherently
improbable in Willenhall having been a temporary royal
residence.&nbsp; King John in much later times had his hunting
lodge at Brewood.&nbsp; Bushbury, originally Bishopsbury, was so
called because one of the early Mercian bishops is said to have
made this place his episcopal residence.&nbsp; Attention has been
called to the fact that in this vicinity a number of place-names
end in &ldquo;hall,&rdquo; as Willenhall, Tettenhall, Walsall,
Pelsall, and Rushall.&nbsp; The inference drawn is that each of
these places marks the settlement of some pioneer Anglican
chieftain, or, as Dr. Oliver puts it, the mansion and estate of
some Saxon thane.</p>

5</span>II.&mdash;The Battle of Wednesfield.</h2>
<p>Although it cannot be admitted that the Battle of Wednesfield,
or the great national victory gained on that occasion, provided
Willenhall with its name, the event itself may certainly be
regarded as the chief historical episode which has occurred in
this immediate vicinity.&nbsp; This was &ldquo;far back in the
olden time&rdquo; when, says the local poetess&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Danes lay camped on Woden&rsquo;s field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Willmore, in his &ldquo;History of Walsall&rdquo; (p. 30),
quotes an authority to the effect that the battle fought at
Wednesfield in the year 911 &ldquo;had the important consequence
of freeing England from the attacks of these formidable
invaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This engagement was one of the many which took place between
the Saxon and the Dane for dynastic supremacy.&nbsp; Even the
mighty prowess of Alfred the Great had failed to give the quietus
to Danish pretensions, and his son, Edward the Elder, was engaged
in a life-long struggle with the Danes, in the course of which
the Princess Ethelfleda, who was Edward&rsquo;s sister, and Great
Alfred&rsquo;s daughter, erected castles at Bridgnorth, Stafford,
Warwick, Tamworth, and Wednesbury.&nbsp; Edward the Elder had to
combat Welsh invasions as well as Danish aggressiveness, and
hence the erection of these castles in Mercia, where most of the
minor fighting in that disturbed period occurred.&nbsp; For nine
years Ethelfleda fought side by side with her husband Ethelred,
Earl of Mercia, in the pitiless struggle; and upon his death,
continuing as her brother&rsquo;s viceroy, she proved herself one
of the ablest women warriors this country has ever known.</p>
<p>In 910 (the Saxon Chronicle informs us) a battle of more than
ordinary moment was fought at Tettenhall.&nbsp; The Danes were
returning from a raid, laden with rich spoils, when they were
overtaken at this spot by the Angles, on the 5th day of August,
and there signally defeated.&nbsp; It was to avenge this disaster
that the Danes swooped down the following summer from the north,
and met their antagonists exactly on the same day of the year,
and almost on the same ground.&nbsp; The latter fact may possibly
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>indicate that there was some strategic importance in the
locality.&nbsp; Wednesfield being almost within hail of
Tettenhall; though the better informed writers, including Mr.
James P. Jones, the historian of Tettenhall, have been led to
consider the two battles as one engagement.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the exact site of the Tettenhall
engagement is not known, yet one historian has not hesitated to
represent the nature of the conflict as being &ldquo;so terrible
that it could not be described by the most exquisite
pen.&rdquo;&nbsp; It seems to have been an engagement of that
old-time ferocity which is so exultantly proclaimed in the
ancient war song:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We there, in strife bewild&rsquo;ring,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spilt blood enough to swim in:<br />
We orphaned many children,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We widowed many women.<br />
The eagles and the ravens<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We glutted with our foemen:<br />
The heroes and the cravens,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The spearmen and the bowmen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Fabius Ethelwerd it was a national and a most
memorable fight which occurred at Wednesfield, where three Danish
chieftains fell in the conflict; in support of which statement it
is mentioned that the Lows, or monumental burial grounds, of the
mighty dead are to be found at Wednesfield and Wrottesley.&nbsp;
But Wrottesley is nearer to Tettenhall than to Wednesfield.&nbsp;
The number of tumuli which once lay scattered over the entire
range of this district may perhaps be accountable for the
variations in the medi&aelig;val chronicles.&nbsp; As we shall
see, while it is well agreed that the country lying between
Tettenhall and Wombourn on the one hand, and Wednesfield and
Willenhall on the other, was the scene of a great struggle, the
details of the conflict vary very materially at the hands of
different chroniclers.&nbsp; A valuable collection of old records
and historical documents relating to this locality was made by
John Huntbach, of Featherstone and Seawall, near Wolverhampton,
nephew and pupil to that noted antiquary, Sir William
Dugdale.&nbsp; The Huntbach MSS. related more directly to
Seisdon; and it was this collection which inspired similar
efforts on the part of the Willenhall Antiquary, Dr. Richard
Wilkes, and ultimately led to the <!-- page 7--><a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>writing of the
Rev. Stebbing Shaw&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Staffordshire&rdquo;
(1798&ndash;1801).</p>
<p>Speaking of the treatment of the battles of Tettenhall and
Wednesfield by the old monkish historians, Huntbach
says:&mdash;&ldquo;There is very great reason to confirm their
testimony who say the battle was here fought; for there are many
tumuli or lows there, that shew some great engagement hereabouts,
viz., the North Lowe, the South Lowe, Little Lowe, Horslowe, and
Thrombelow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first four being yet visible, the North Lowe, near
in lands to croft-lodge, the South Lowe near Mr. Hope&rsquo;s
windmill, the great and little lowe in the heath grounds; but
Horslowe is not discernible by reason of the coal-works that have
been here, only it giveth name to the Horselowe Field, since
called Horsehull Field, now Horseley Field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are not only these, but several others,
partly in the way betwixt this place and Tottenhall, as at Low
Hill, near Seawall, a very large one, and at Hampton Town; and
another which giveth name to a field called Ablow Field, upon
which stands a bush now called Isley Cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ablow
Field covered 40 acres of unenclosed ground near Graiseley Brook,
and the tumulus once occupied the site now covered by St.
Paul&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p>Dr. Plot believes the ancient remains in Wrottesley Park to be
&ldquo;those of the old Tettenhall of the Danes, who, having
resided there for some time, built themselves this city, or place
of habitation, which, in the year 907, was finally demolished by
Edward the Elder in a most signal and destructive victory.&nbsp;
To revenge this fatal quarrel, another army of Danes collected in
Northumbria, and invaded Mercia in the same year, when King
Edward, with a powerful force of West Saxons and Mercians
overtook them at the village of Wednesfield, near Theotenhall
(Tettenhall), and vanquished them again, with much
slaughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another account, given by the aforementioned Dr. Wilkes,
Willenhall&rsquo;s most eminent son, and no mean authority on
such matters, says that:&mdash;&ldquo;In the year 895, King
Alfred having by a stratagem forced them to leave Hereford on the
Wye, they came <!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>up to the River Severn as far as
Bridgnorth, then called Quat, Quatbridge, or Quatford, committing
great enormities, and destroying all before them.&nbsp; We hear
no more of them hereabout for thirteen years, but then they
raised a great army and fought two bloody battles with King
Edward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contemporary Saxon annals tell us that the Danes were
beaten in Mercia in 911, but do not say where.&nbsp; Doubtless
from time to time the whole plain rang with &ldquo;the din of
battle bray,&rdquo; the shout of exultation, and the groan of
pain; with the clash of steel on steel, and the dull thud of
mighty battleaxe on shields of tough bull hide, all through that
disturbed period.&nbsp; It would appear from a later account that
at the earlier engagement of 910, which by this writer has been
confidently located between Tettenhall and the Wergs, King Edward
was himself in command of the Saxon forces, and that he not only
gained a decisive victory, but pursued the enemy for five weeks,
following them up in their northern fastnesses beyond the Watling
Street, from one Danish village to another, burning and utterly
wasting every one of them as they had been mere hornets&rsquo;
nests.</p>
<p>At the encounter of the following year (<span
class="smcap">a.d.</span> 911) the Danes, after a great pillaging
expedition, having strongly posted themselves at Wednesfield,
little advantage was gained by either side after many hours of
hard fighting, till at last the Saxons were reinforced by Earl
Kenwolf.&nbsp; Victory then fell to the Saxons.</p>
<p>This Kenwolf, who is said to have been the greatest notable of
the locality, and seated on a good estate at Stowe Heath, was
mortally wounded in the fray; and on the opposite side there fell
Healfden and Ecwills, two Danish kings; Ohter and Scurfar, two of
their Earls; a number of other great noblemen and generals, among
them Othulf, Beneting, Therferth, Guthferth, Agmund, Anlaf the
Black, and Osferth the tax-gatherer, and a host of men.&nbsp; The
name of a third slaughtered king, Fuver, is given by another old
chronicler.&nbsp; It is to the quality rather than to the
quantity of the slain that the locality is indebted for the
number of tumuli on which so much of this superstructure of
quasi-history seems to be raised.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>The historians who restrict themselves to
&ldquo;two&rdquo; kings specify the North Lowe at Wednesfield as
the sepulchral monument of one, and the South Lowe of the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was,&rdquo; says Shaw, the county
historian, &ldquo;a little to the south of the Walsall Road, half
a mile south-west of the village of Nechels, a great low called
Stowman Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Plot, writing in 1686, declares &ldquo;the bank above
Nechels, where now is a stone pit, Stowman Low, now removed to
mend the roads, and Northfield, to be the genuine remains; but
the bank where the windmill stood was a hard rock, several yards
below the surface of the earth, and there was nothing remarkable
found upon the removing of Stowman Low, so that all this is
uncertainty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the precise location of the Tettenhall battleground
has always puzzled the antiquaries, there are, says one
authority, &ldquo;three lows on the common between Wombourn and
Swin, placed in a right line that runs directly east and west,
and about half a mile to the north of them is another, by the
country people called Soldiers&rsquo; Hill.&nbsp; They are all
large and capable of covering a great number of dead bodies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There cannot be the least doubt but this place was the
scene of action, for King Edward, to perpetuate the memory of
this signal victory, I presume, here founded a church, called by
the name of the place Wonbourn, now Wombourn; and took this whole
parish out of the parish of Tettenhall, which, before this
battle, extended as far as the forest of Kinver.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
may be added, for whatever such support is worth, that in times
past a number of ancient weapons have been dug up at
Wombourne.</p>
<p>Coming to the latest and most reliable authority, Mr. W. H.
Duignan, of Walsall, here is what he writes in his admirable
work, &ldquo;Staffordshire Place Names,&rdquo; under the heading
&ldquo;Low Hill,&rdquo; which is the name of an ancient estate at
Bushbury:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huntbach the antiquary, wrote in the 17th century that
there was then a very large tumulus here.&nbsp; Much, if not the
whole of it, has been since destroyed.&nbsp; The hill is lofty
and a place likely to be selected for the burial of some
prehistoric magnate.&nbsp; In <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>911 a battle
was fought between the Saxons and the Danes, called in the
Chronicles the battle of Tettenhall, but which was really waged
on Wednesfield Heath (now Heath Town).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dead were buried as usual under mounds, which in
Huntbach&rsquo;s time still remained, and were known as North
Low, South Low, the Little Low, the Great Low, Horselow,
Tromelow, and Ablow (many of these names survive), besides others
which had then disappeared.&nbsp; It is therefore difficult to
say whether the low here was a prehistoric tumulus or a battle
mound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Langford, in his &ldquo;Staffordshire and
Warwickshire&rdquo; (p. 177), writing less than forty years ago,
says that &ldquo;a large number of tumuli exist near
Wednesfield&rdquo;; but the utilitarianism of the farmer and the
miner would make it difficult to find many of these grass-crowned
records on the Willenhall side of the battleground now.&nbsp; Dr.
Windle, in his able work, &ldquo;Remains of the Prehistoric Age
in England&rdquo; (published in 1904) gives a list of existing
Barrows and Burial-mounds in this country, including some nine or
ten in Staffordshire, but makes no mention of Wednesfield,
Wombourne, or Tettenhall.</p>

11</span>II.&mdash;The Saxon Settlement</h2>
<p>Fourteen or fifteen centuries ago the cluster of places which
we now know as the town of Wolverhampton, and the numerous
industrial centres grouped around it, were then primitive Saxon
settlements, each of them peopled by the few families that
claimed kinship with each other.</p>
<p>These embryo townships were dotted about the clearings which
had been made in the thick primeval forest with which the whole
face of England was then covered, save only where the surface was
barren hill or undrained swamp.&nbsp; Does not the terminal
&ldquo;field,&rdquo; in such a place-name as Wednesfield,
literally mean &ldquo;feld,&rdquo; or the woodland clearing from
which the timbers had been &ldquo;felled&rdquo;?&nbsp; Each
settlement, whether called a &ldquo;ham&rdquo; (that is, a home),
or a &ldquo;tun&rdquo; (otherwise a town), was a
farmer-commonwealth, cultivating the village fields in common;
each was surrounded by a &ldquo;mark,&rdquo; or belt of waste
land, which no man might appropriate, and no stranger advance
across without first blowing his horn to give timely notice of
his approach.&nbsp; Remnants of these open unappropriated lands
may be traced by such place-names as Wednesfield
&ldquo;Heath,&rdquo; and Monmore &ldquo;Green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the outset each settlement at its foundation was
independent of, and co-equal with, the others; Saxon society
being founded on a system of family groupings, and a government
of the ancient patriarchal type.</p>
<p>All questions of government and public interest were settled
by the voice of the people in &ldquo;moot,&rdquo; or open-air
meeting, assembled beneath the shelter of some convenient
tree.&nbsp; Our ancestors were an open-air, freedom-loving
people, who mistrusted walls and contemned fortifications.&nbsp;
In course of time, however, the exigencies of their
environment&mdash;the aggressiveness of neighbours and
foreigners, the incursions of invaders and
marauders&mdash;materially modified their views, and changed
their habits in this respect; and so it came about in the scheme
of national defence that the temple-crowned hill of Woden became
Woden&rsquo;s burh <!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>(now Wednesbury), a hill fortified by
deep ditch and high stockade.</p>
<p>Presently the family tie gave way to the lordship, as certain
chiefs, under the stress of circumstances, acquired domination
over others, and hence arose the manor or residential lordship,
the head of which took pledges for the fidelity of those below
him, and in turn became responsible for them to the king above
him&mdash;a system of mutual inter-dependence from the head of
the state downwards.&nbsp; Under these new conditions Stow Heath
became the head of a Saxon manor, in which were involved
Willenhall, Wolverhampton, Bilston, Wednesfield, Eccleshall, and
a number of other village settlements.&nbsp; Some of these,
however, were in the Hundred of Seisdon, and some in the Hundred
of Offlow&mdash;a &ldquo;hundred&rdquo; being originally the
division of a county that contained a hundred villages.</p>
<p>The unregenerate Teuton was a pirate and a plunderer; the
settled Saxon became an oversea trader and trafficker.&nbsp; The
Anglo-Saxon merchant of later and more settled times, raised by
his wealth to the dignity of a thane, became a landed man, and a
lord over his fellows.&nbsp; Herein we have the transition from a
free village community to a Saxon manor.</p>
<p>At Wolverhampton was seated one Wolfric, said to have been an
ancestor of Wolfgeat, and a relation to Wulfruna; his manor house
was situated on the slope of the hill between the present North
Street and Waterloo Road&mdash;doubtless a large rambling mansion
of low elevation, built of heavy timbers on a low plinth of
boulders and hewn stones.</p>
<p>Here at Hantun he kept his state&mdash;such as the luxury of
the age permitted to him.&nbsp; Seated in his great oaken hall,
with its heavy roof timbers, at the close of each day he drank
deep draughts with his guests and his numerous servants, in the
flaring light of odorous resin torches stuck in iron staples
along the walls.&nbsp; The smoke from his fire of logs escaped as
lazily as it might through an aperture in the roof.&nbsp; The
earthen floor was strewn with rushes, more or less clean as it
was littered by the refuse of few or more feasts.&nbsp; The only
furniture consisted of a long trestle <!-- page 13--><a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>table, with
rude benches of oak on each side; the whole effort at
ornamentation being limited to trophies of war and the chase
hanging upon the walls.&nbsp; Such, in brief, was the home life
of a great thane.</p>
<p>It will be observed that Wednesfield and Wednesbury at least
were founded by the Saxons in their pagan days; that is before
their acceptance of the White Christ, which was towards the close
of the seventh century.&nbsp; Tradition hath it that at the
Anglian advent into this district, the worship of Woden was first
set up in a grove at Wednesfield.&nbsp; Here was first fixed the
Woden Stone, the sacred altar on which human sacrifices were
offered of that dread Teutonic deity, Woden.</p>
<p>It was carved with Runic figures&mdash;for was not Woden the
inventor of the Runic characters?&nbsp; In sacrificing, the
priest, at the slaying of the victim, took care to consecrate the
offering by pronouncing always the solemn formula, &ldquo;I
devote thee to Woden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of the blood was then sprinkled on the worshippers, part
on the sacred grove; the bodies were then either burnt on the
altar or suspended on trees within this mystic grove.&nbsp;
Later, when some advance had been made by the hierarchy, the
Woden Stone was removed from the Wednesfield grove to be erected
within the temple of Woden at Wednesbury.</p>
<p>There are other evidences of pagan practices to be discovered
in Staffordshire place-names.&nbsp; Tutbury is said to derive its
name from Tuisto, the Saxon god who gave the name to Tuesday, as
Woden lent his to Wednesday; and Thursfield from Thor, the deity
worshipped on Thursday.&nbsp; There is also Thor&rsquo;s cave,
still so-called, in the north of this county (see
&ldquo;Staffordshire Curiosities,&rdquo; p. 159), and other
similar reminders of Anglo-Saxon paganism.</p>
<p>It is not outside the bounds of possibility that a third local
place-name is traceable to the personality of Woden.&nbsp;
Sedgley may be derived from Sigge&rsquo;s Lea, and Sigge was the
real name of the Teutonic conqueror who, in overrunning
north-west Europe, assumed the name of Woden for the sake of
prestige&mdash;he was the <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>founder of
Sigtuna, otherwise Sigge&rsquo;s town, in Sweden.&nbsp; In the
science of English place-names it is well-known that while hills
and streams and other natural phenomena were allowed to retain
their old British names (as Barr, &ldquo;a summit,&rdquo; and
Tame, &ldquo;a flood water&rdquo;), towns, villages, and other
political divisions were very generally renamed by the Saxon
conquerors, the places in many instances being called after the
personal names of their owners.</p>
<p>Here are some local illustrations of place-names conferred by
the Anglian invaders when they had conquered and appropriated the
territory.</p>
<p>Arley, otherwise Earnlege, was &ldquo;the Eagle&rsquo;s
ley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bilston signifies &ldquo;the town of Bil&rsquo;s
folk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blakenhall was &ldquo;the hall of Blac.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bloxwich was &ldquo;the village of Bloc&rdquo;: as Wightwick
was &ldquo;Wiht&rsquo;s village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bushbury was &ldquo;the Bishop&rsquo;s burg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chillington was originally &ldquo;Cille&rsquo;s
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Codsall was &ldquo;Code&rsquo;s hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darlaston was once &ldquo;Deorlaf&rsquo;s town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dunstall, otherwise Tunstall, was &ldquo;an enclosed
farmstead,&rdquo; half a mile outside the ancient boundary of
Cannock Forest.</p>
<p>Essington was &ldquo;the town of the descendants of
Esne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ettingshall was &ldquo;the hall of the Etri family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Featherstone seems to have been &ldquo;Feader&rsquo;s
stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to a charter of the year 994 there
was then a large stone called the &ldquo;Warstone,&rdquo; to mark
the boundary of this place.</p>
<p>Hatherton, or Hagathornden, signifies &ldquo;the hill of the
hawthorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kinvaston was perhaps &ldquo;Cyneweald&rsquo;s
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Olive in his &ldquo;History of
Wolverhampton Church,&rdquo; says that being originally a place
of consequence.&nbsp; Kinvaston was placed at the head of the
Wolverhampton prebends.</p>
<p>Moseley was the &ldquo;mossy or marshy lea&rdquo;: as Bradley
the &ldquo;broad lea&rdquo;; and Bentley was the &ldquo;lea of
bent&rdquo; or reedy grass.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>Newbolds, an ancient farm in Wednesfield, is an
Anglo-Saxon name, &ldquo;niwe bold,&rdquo; and it pointed out
&ldquo;the new house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ogley Hay, now called Brownhills, was originally Ocginton, or
&ldquo;Ocga&rsquo;s town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pelsall may be translated &ldquo;Peol&rsquo;s Hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pendeford was once &ldquo;Penda&rsquo;s ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scotlands were &ldquo;the corner-lands,&rdquo; this hamlet
being at the corner of a triangular piece of land, bounded on all
sides by ancient roads.</p>
<p>Seisdon was probably &ldquo;the Saxon&rsquo;s Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Showells, or Sewalls, at Bushbury, on the confines of Cannock
Forest, was the place where &ldquo;scarecrows&rdquo; (as the name
probably means) were set up or shown on hedgetops to prevent the
deer passing from the Forest on to enclosed or cultivated
land.</p>
<p>Stowe, a name signifying an enclosed or
&ldquo;stockaded&rdquo; place, was another seat of a great thane;
or it might have been the residential portion of the large manor
or lordship already alluded to.</p>
<p>Tettenhall was possibly Tetta&rsquo;s hall; or, more probably,
&ldquo;Spy hall,&rdquo; otherwise a watch tower.</p>
<p>Tromelow, commonly called Rumbelows, a farm on the site of one
of the Wednesfield lows, is a name that may literally mean
&ldquo;the burial mound of the host.&rdquo;&nbsp; The corruption
Rumbelow is probably made out of the phrase &ldquo;At
Tromelowe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wergs (The), through many transformations from Wytheges to
Wyrges, is &ldquo;the withy hedges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wobaston, an estate in Bushbury, was anciently
&ldquo;Wibald&rsquo;s town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wombourne was the &ldquo;bourne (or brook) in the
hollow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wolverhampton was at first Heantune, or Hamtun, otherwise the
&ldquo;High town,&rdquo; to which name was prefixed soon after
the year 994 that of Wulfrun, a lady of rank who gave great
possessions to the Church; and hence was evolved the more
distinctive name, Wulfrunhamtun, since modified into its present
form.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Although some of these names (as Showells, formerly
Sewall) may not date quite back to the Saxon period, most of them
may be accepted as present-day evidences of the great Teutonic
descent upon this Midland locality.&nbsp; One of the very few
Celtic place-names retained from the previous occupiers is
Monmore, which in the tongue of the ancient Britons signified
&ldquo;the boggy mere.&rdquo;</p>

17</span>IV.&mdash;The Founding of Wulfruna&rsquo;s Church, 996,
A.D.</h2>
<p>After the advent of Christianity, the new religion was
gradually advanced throughout the land by the settlement of
priest-missioners in the various localities.&nbsp; Where the
missionary settled on the invitation, or under the protection of
a thane, or &ldquo;lord,&rdquo; that lordship was formed into a
parish.&nbsp; Thus some parishes doubtless became co-terminous
with the old manors.&nbsp; Owing, however, to the many changes of
jurisdiction in the course of succeeding centuries, it is
difficult to find instances of parish and manor of identical area
in this locality.&nbsp; Bescot was a manor within the parish of
Walsall; Bloxwich and Shelfield were anciently members of the
manor of Wednesbury, though now included in Walsall; Bentley, at
the Norman Conquest, was part of the manor of Willenhall, then
belonging to Wolverhampton Church; while Dunstall was a member of
the King&rsquo;s manor of Stow Heath.&nbsp; Tettenhall parish
originally included as many as a dozen manors and townships.</p>
<p>England is made up of some ten thousand parishes, each with
its parish church, around which for a thousand years has revolved
the social and political, as well as the whole religious life of
the place.&nbsp; The parish is our unit of local government, and
the history of a town is usually a history of the parish.</p>
<p>But Willenhall never was a parish.&nbsp; It is merely a member
of a parish&mdash;of the extensive, the straggling, and
loosely-knit parish of Wolverhampton.&nbsp; In Wolverhampton,
three miles away, was located the mother church, to which it owed
spiritual allegiance, and there was situated the Vestry for
parochial assemblies, and all else that stood for self-government
throughout the centuries.&nbsp; And those were the centuries when
Church and State were indissolubly bound together; when a
dominant church claimed, and was recognised as having an
inalienable share in the government of the people.&nbsp; Hence it
will transpire in these pages that for centuries the story of
Willenhall was involved in the ecclesiastical history of
Wolverhampton.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>The ancient parish of Wolverhampton lies widely
dispersed and very detached, containing no less than 17 townships
and hamlets, all subject to the collegiate church in matters
ecclesiastical, though in many cases being distinct in matters
secular.&nbsp; How broken the area is may be noted in the case of
Pelsall, which is cut off from the mother parish by Bloxwich, a
hamlet in Walsall parish.</p>
<p>Willenhall is one among several other neighbouring places
that, from the earliest period of England&rsquo;s acceptance of
Christianity, had its fate inseparably linked with that of
Wolverhampton.&nbsp; In the giving way of paganism before the
steady advances of the new religion, progress in this immediate
part of the kingdom was marked by the founding of Tettenhall
Church (<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 966), followed thirty
years afterwards by Lady Wulfruna&rsquo;s further efforts at
evangelisation in the setting up at Hampton (or High Town) of
another Christian church.</p>
<p>This was in the reign of Ethelred the Unrede, which was a
period sadly troubled by the aggressions of the Danes; and it is
believed that Wulfruna (or Wulfrun) had designed to found a
monastery, though as early as the time of Edward the Confessor,
or within a century of its institution, her establishment is
found to be a Collegiate Church.</p>
<p>With this accession of dignity, and in grateful recognition of
the lady&rsquo;s pious munificence, the town became known as
Wulfrun&rsquo;s Hampton, now modified in Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>Of Wulfruna herself but little is known.&nbsp; Whether she was
sister of King Edgar, as some suppose, or the widow of Aldhelm,
Duke of Northumberland, cannot be decided.&nbsp; It is known,
however, that she was a lady of rank, and was captured when Olaf,
in command of a Viking host, took Tamworth by storm.&nbsp;
Hampton did not bear her name until some years after her
death.</p>
<p>In founding her noble church at Wolverhampton, Wulfruna
endowed it with thirteen estates, including lands in Willenhall,
Wednesfield, Pelsall, Essington, Hilton, Walsall, Featherstone,
Hatherton, Kinvaston, Bilston, and Arley.&nbsp; Willenhall being
only three miles away from Wolverhampton, and being also for a
long <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>time ecclesiastically incorporated with it, its history
at many points cannot be detached from that of the mother
parish.</p>
<p>The wording of the charter by which the gift was made is
quaintly interesting.&nbsp; It sets forth that: &ldquo;In the
year 996, from the Passion of our said Lord and Saviour, Jesus
Christ,&rdquo; Sigeric, Archbishop of Canterbury, &ldquo;with the
Lord&rsquo;s flock of servants unceasingly serving God,&rdquo;
have granted a privilege &ldquo;to the noble matron and religious
woman Wulfruna,&rdquo; in &ldquo;order that she may attain a seat
in heaven,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;for her mass may be said
unceasingly for ever&rdquo; in the &ldquo;ancient monastery of
Hamtun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Charter (inter alia) grants &ldquo;ten hides of land for
the body of my husband,&rdquo; and another &ldquo;ten hides of
land&rdquo; for the offences of her &ldquo;Kinsman
Wulfgeal&rdquo; lest he should hear in the judgment the
&ldquo;dreaded&rdquo; sentence, &ldquo;Go away from me,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; A third &ldquo;ten hides&rdquo; of land are granted
on account of &ldquo;my sole daughter Elfthryth,&rdquo; who
&ldquo;has migrated from the world to the life-giving
airs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Duignan, who has made a close study of the Charter, says
&ldquo;the limits of the parishes and of the townships included
in the grant are now precisely what they were a thousand years
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boundaries of the lands conferred by the noble
benefactress are set forth with much precision, as in the noting
of brooks and fords, of parks and woods, of fields and lanes and
lands; and in very few cases has Mr. Duignan failed to recognise
the old names and identify them with the modern appellations of
the places meant, among the latter being Willenhall, Wednesfield,
Pelsall, Hilton, Ogley Hay, Hatherton, Cannock, Moseley Hole,
Twyford, Walsall, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The original Charter has not been heard of since 1646, when it
was supposed to be copied by Sir William Dugdale into his
monumental work, the &ldquo;Monasticon,&rdquo; assisted by Roger
Dodsworth, a joint editor with him.&nbsp; If it is still in
existence Mr. Duignan assumes it is in the possession of the Dean
and Chapter of the Royal Chapel of Windsor, with which the
Deanery of Wolverhampton was united&mdash;as will be seen
later.&nbsp; The formal parts of the deed are in Latin, and the
descriptions of the properties are <!-- page 20--><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>in
Anglo-Saxon, which makes it an interesting study of
place-names.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton church, dedicated to St. Mary, was a collegiate
establishment, with a dean as president, and a number of
prebendaries or canons who were &ldquo;secular&rdquo; priests,
and not brethren of any of the regular &ldquo;orders of
monks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the privileges which the College possessed in Lady
Wulfruna&rsquo;s lifetime were afterwards confirmed by Edward the
Confessor, and subsequently by William the Conqueror.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The dedication of Wulfruna&rsquo;s church and its consecration
by Sigeric, the archbishop, have been described in verse by a
local poetess.&nbsp; This was Mrs. Frank P. Fellows, a daughter
of the famous Sir Rowland Hill, and once resident at Goldthorn
Hill.&nbsp; Her husband was a native of Wolverhampton, a
distinguished public servant, connected with the Admiralty, a
Knight of St. John of Jerusalem, an antiquarian and a
scientist.&nbsp; In a book of his published poems appear
portraits of himself and his wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fellows (whose mother, Lady Hill, was a daughter of
Joseph Pearson, Esq., J.P., of Graiseley), also wrote
poems&mdash;some of which appeared in &ldquo;Punch,&rdquo; some
in &ldquo;Belgravia,&rdquo; and some in other magazines&mdash;and
published a small book of verse in 1857.</p>
<p>It is from one long piece, entitled &ldquo;Fancies by the
Fire,&rdquo; in which the long retrospect of
Wolverhampton&rsquo;s ancient history unrolls itself before the
imagination of the poetess, that the following extracts are
taken.&nbsp; After a description of the battle of Wednesfield, we
read:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Princess Wulfruna heard the deeds,<br />
Told by the fire in her stately hall.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! then said the gentle dame,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It grieves me sore such things should be.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, by the Christ that died on tree,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Christ that died for them and me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These heathen souls shall all be free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From sin, and pain of Purgat&rsquo;ry;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In token of our victory,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where masses shall be sung and said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And prayers told for the restless dead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That wander still on Woden&rsquo;s Plain&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It shall be raised in Mary&rsquo;s name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>The noble lady with her train, and accompanied by the
Archbishop Sigeric, pays a visit of inspection to the locality
she designs thus to honour, passing beneath the shade of
&ldquo;the forest trees of Theotanhall&rdquo; on her
way&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And as they passed thro&rsquo; Dunstall Wood,<br
/>
And stopped to drink where a streamlet fell,<br />
Then said the lady fair and good<br />
Here will I build a wayside well.<br />
Now Hampton town before them lay.<br />
But first they sought out Woden&rsquo;s plain,<br />
Where lay the bleached bones of the slain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the Archbishop had offered up a prayer for the
dead&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>At length they stood upon the height<br />
That rises over Hampton town;<br />
There, amid knight, and dame, and priest,<br />
The Princess Wulfrune laid the stone,<br />
The first stone on the holy fane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then solemnly the pious lady removed from her royal brows the
golden coronet that hitherto had graced it, and put in place of
it a crown of thorns, saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It were ill done that I have worn<br />
A golden crown, while Jesus sweet<br />
For my sake wore a crown of thorn;<br />
And here I dedicate my days<br />
To Him until my life be sped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus far the foundation of the mother church&mdash;much more
of the town&rsquo;s history follows in like strain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Willenhall was slightly connected with another religious
foundation.&nbsp; In the year 1002 Burton Abbey was founded by
Wulfric Spott, Earl of Mercia.&nbsp; This establishment was
richly endowed with lands, not only in Staffordshire, but also
with estates in Derbyshire and Warwickshire.</p>
<p>The names of the various places included in this munificent
grant afford a very interesting study in Saxon
nomenclature.&nbsp; For instance, in the Second Indorsement of
the Charter conferring the noble gift, we may be interested to
discover that &ldquo;2 hides of land in Wilinhale,&rdquo; lying
in &ldquo;Offalawe Hundred&rdquo; are among the properties
donated to this great Staffordshire Monastery.</p>
<h2><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>V.&mdash;The Collegiate Establishment</h2>
<p>We cannot be too insistent on the close connection long
subsisting between Willenhall and Wolverhampton owing to the fact
of the former being a part of Wulfruna&rsquo;s endowment of her
collegiate church.</p>
<p>Wulfruna&rsquo;s foundation consisted of a dean, eight
prebendaries or canons, and a sacrist.&nbsp; The dean was the
president of this chapter, or congregation of clergy, whose duly
was to chant the daily service.&nbsp; The sacrist was also a
cleric, but his duties were more generally concerned with the
college establishment.</p>
<p>A prebendary, it may be explained, is one who enjoys a prebend
or canonical portion; that is, who receives in right of his
place, a share out of the common stock of the church for his
maintenance.&nbsp; Each prebend of Wolverhampton church was
endowed with the income arising from the lands from which it took
its name; as, the prebend of Willenhall.&nbsp; In the course of
time the tithes derivable from these lands became alienated.</p>
<p>Sampson Erdeswick, whose history of this county was commenced
in 1593, says the foundation was effectuated in 970 by King
Edgar, at the request of his dying sister, Wulfruna.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She founded a chapel of eight portionaries (is the way
Erdeswick puts it) whom, by incorporation, she made rector of
that parish (Wolverhampton) to receive the tithes in common, but
devisable by a yearly lot.&nbsp; The head or chief of these she
made patron to them all, and sole ordinary of that whole
parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foundation was designated the &ldquo;royal free church of
Wolverhampton,&rdquo; the term &ldquo;free&rdquo; signifying that
it was free of the ordinary supervision of the ecclesiastical
authorities, being exempt from both episcopal jurisdiction and
the papal supremacy.&nbsp; Indeed, it had been better for the
church had it been less free, for in the time of King John the
debaucheries and gross immoralities of these undisciplined
parochial clergy brought much discredit upon the priestly
college.</p>
<p><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>The dean and the prebends had special seats or stalls in
the choir of the church; the sacrist had no stall, neither had he
any voice in the chapter.&nbsp; In modern times (1811) the
sacrist has become the perpetual curate of the parish.</p>
<p>It will be noted that the head of this college of seculars was
styled the &ldquo;sole ordinary&rdquo; of the parish, which is
equivalent to saying he was invested with judicial powers therein
like a bishop in a diocese.&nbsp; He had authority cum omnimoda
jurisdictione, and was exempt not only from the episcopal
over-lordship of Coventry and Lichfield by express composition,
but also by papal bull from the legates and delegates of Rome for
ever.&nbsp; In fact, so independent was the foundation made at
the outset, it remained for centuries subject only to the royal
authority of the Majesty of England, and under it to the
perpetual visitation of the Keepers of the Great Seal for the
time being.</p>
<p>In the year 1338, Edward III. confirmed the charter of the
church as a royal free chapter, giving the Dean the jurisdiction
of a Court Leet, and a copyhold Court Baron, to be called the
Deanery Court of Wolverhampton.&nbsp; About this time, too, the
church was rebuilt on more spacious and magnificent lines.&nbsp;
Mrs. Fellows, in her topographical rhyme, previously quoted,
sings of the erection of the tower</p>
<blockquote><p>In the third Edward&rsquo;s time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The college then consisted of the ten members of the
foundation just mentioned, augmented by other ministers and
officers necessary for conducting so large an establishment, the
prebendaries being officially mentioned in this order:&mdash;(1)
Wolverhampton; (2) Kinvaston; (3) Featherstone; (4) Hilton; (5)
Willenhall; (6) Monmore; (7) Wobaston; (8) Hatherton.</p>
<p>By the fifteenth century Chantries had been founded, and
chapels erected therefor, at Willenhall, Bilston, Pelsall, and at
Hatherton; and in further depreciation of the mother church, King
Edward IV., about 1465, with a desire to enrich the Collegiate
Church of St. George, at Windsor, annexed Wolverhampton to that
chapel royal.</p>
<p>In Protestant times the daily services were performed by the
sacrist and the readers, the prebendaries officiating on Sundays
in <!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>rotation, according to a set cycle.&nbsp; The time set
out for the prebendary of Willenhall commenced on the Sunday
after Ash Wednesday; till eventually exemption was purchased by
the payment of a small fee to the Perpetual Curate.</p>
<p>In olden times it was a common practice to carve the choir
seats.&nbsp; The prebendal stalls in Wolverhampton church were
marked with heraldic shields charged with simple ordinaries, in
the following manner:&mdash;the following manner:&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">ON THE SOUTH SIDE.</p>

<p>To assist in the identification of the various estates
chargeable with the provisions of the prebends, or canonical
portions, it may be useful to give here a brief account of a
perambulation of the Wolverhampton parish boundaries made in
1824.</p>
<p>It was a regular Rogation ceremony of &ldquo;beating the
bounds&rdquo; and occupied three whole days, so widely scattered
is this extensive, far-reaching parish.&nbsp; It will be observed
that the Hatherton here dealt with is not the Staffordshire
village of that name, two miles north-west of Cannock.&nbsp;
Wobaston, it will be remembered, has previously been mentioned as
situated in Bushbury; while Monmore Green is still a well-known
place-name.&nbsp; The other names occur in self-explanatory
context.&nbsp; The detailed account of this perambulation, of
which the following is but a summary, will be found in the
appendix to Dr. Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;History&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<p>On Monday, May 24th, the churchwardens and their party
assembled at the Rev. Thomas Walker&rsquo;s, and proceeded to a
cottage near the eighth milestone on the Stafford Road, and at
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>the well in the cottage garden there, the Gospel was
read for the first time.&nbsp; (It was the custom at these
Rogation processionings to read the Gospel under
trees&mdash;especially those growing near to some reputed
&ldquo;holy&rdquo; well&mdash;located on or near a parish
boundary, hence their name &ldquo;Gospel trees.&rdquo;)</p>
<p>From thence a lane near the third milestone on the same road
led the procession to Kinvaston, where the Gospel was read at an
Elder in the fold-yard of a house of a Mrs. Wooton.&nbsp; Then
the procession went to Hatherton, the seat of the late Moreton
Walhouse, where the Gospel was again read on the site of an old
well.&nbsp; Proceeding to Hilton, the seat of the Vernons, the
Gospelling was repeated within the gates fronting the house.</p>
<p>Crossing the Cannock Road, the Gospel was read for the fifth
and last time, that day, under an oak tree in the road near the
house of Mr. W. Price, of Featherstone.</p>
<p>On the second day, May 25th, the parishioners assembled as
before, and proceeded direct to Wednesfield, where the Gospel was
read in the Chapel, the clerk being in readiness at the door to
receive the procession.&nbsp; Thence the perambulation was
continued to Essington, where the common was found to be
enclosed; the Gospel was read a second time there at the Goswell
Bush, which, standing in the Bloxwich Road, was found to be
surrounded by a new growth of trees.&nbsp; (Just previous to this
period there had been a rage for enclosing commons&mdash;the
people&rsquo;s lands.)&nbsp; Turning back, the party proceeded to
Pelsall, where the Gospel was read the third and last time, that
day, in the Chapel there.</p>
<p>On the third day, which was Thursday, May 27th, the assembly
was made at the Swan Inn, and the procession was formed
there.&nbsp; The way was led straight to Willenhall, where the
Gospel was read for the first time in the Chapel, the expectant
clerk being there in readiness to perform the duty.&nbsp; From
thence the perambulation was continued to Park Brook, which was
crossed; returning, the way was taken to Bentley Hall, the seat
of Edward Anson, Esq., where the second reading of the Gospel was
taken at an elder bush at the back of the house.&nbsp; (Elders
seem to have taken the place of the ancient &ldquo;Gospel
oaks&rdquo; in this locality.)</p>
<p><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>From Willenhall the party next proceeded to Bilston,
where the third reading of the Gospel was performed within the
Chapel of that township.</p>
<p>From thence a move was made to Bradeley Hall, then in the
occupation of Mr. Nailer, at the bottom of whose garden was the
site of an old well, which had once been a bath, and here the
Gospelling was again celebrated.</p>
<p>The procession was then resumed through Bilston by
Catchem&rsquo;s Corner, Goldthorne Hill, and the Penn Road, to
St. John&rsquo;s Chapel, otherwise known as the New Church,
within which the Gospel was ceremonially read for the last
time.&nbsp; This concluded the perambulation, and an entry of its
various details were duly entered in the Parish Book, and signed
by Tho. Walker, minister, and Wm. Buckle and Jos. Smart, the two
churchwardens.</p>

27</span>VI&mdash;Willenhall at the Norman Conquest
(1066&ndash;1086).</h2>
<p>After the Norman invasion of 1066 it took a number of years to
complete the conquest of the country.&nbsp; It was not till 1086
that the &ldquo;Domesday&rdquo; Book was compiled&mdash;written
evidence of a settlement of the land question which, it was
fondly hoped (and expressed in the name), would last till
&ldquo;Domesday&rdquo;!</p>
<p>The Domesday Book was a great national land register in which
was entered a record of every acre of land in England, its
condition, its ownership, and annual value at that time.&nbsp;
For on land ownership alone then depended not only the amount of
the national revenue, but the strength of the national
defences.&nbsp; Willenhall, wrongly written by the Domesday
scribes as Winehala, is returned as being in the Hundred of
Offlow, and having an area of 2,168 acres.</p>
<p>Of this acreage 3 hides belonged to the old domains of the
Crown, like Bilston and Wednesbury (having formerly formed part
of the dominions of the Saxon kings), while but two hides of
Willenhall land belonged to Wolverhampton church.&nbsp; It is
believed that the King&rsquo;s manorial portion took with it
Bentley, with its 1,650 acres.</p>
<p>Anyway, Willenhall having belonged originally to the ancient
Mercian kings, and having been held in succession by all the
Saxon kings of England to Edward the Confessor and Harold II.,
naturally passed as a royal manor, or rather, a portion thereof,
into the hands of the Conqueror, being set down among the Crown
lands as of &ldquo;ancient demesne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Domesday Book also sets down among the possessions of the
Canons of Wolverhampton 2,200 acres in Wednesfield, 1,194 acres
in Pelsall, both in the same Hundred; 3,396 acres in
Wolverhampton, 3,912 acres in Arley, and 6,377 acres, a part of
Bushbury, are set down in Seisdon Hundred; the Essington portion
of Bushbury, once belonging to the Countess Godiva, is reckoned
in Cuddlestone Hundred, in which are also given the <!-- page
28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>four
other portions of Wolverhampton, namely Hilton, Hatherton,
Kinvaston, and Featherstone.</p>
<p>Since the eleventh century the boundaries of the Hundreds of
Offlow and Cuddlestone have been altered.&nbsp; As to the Arley
estate, that was lost to the canons ere another century had
elapsed&mdash;by 1172 had escheated to the Crown.</p>
<p>The present-day acreage of Wolverhampton parish is no less
than 17,449; made up of 3,396 acres in Wolverhampton proper,
1,845 in Bilston, and 1,650 in Bentley, a total of 6,891 acres in
Seisdon Hundred; thus leaving 10,608 acres to constitute Hilton
(two manors, since united into one) Hatherton, Kinvaston,
Featherstone, and Hocintune.&nbsp; The last-named was a manor
which, at that time, probably lay between Hilton and Hatherton,
within Wolverhampton; the name is obsolete.</p>
<p>These ten estates, comprising Wolverhampton, Willenhall (part
of), Arley (part of), Bushbury (part of), Hilton (part of),
Pelsall, Wednesfield, Cote (near Penn), Haswic (near Newcastle),
and Hocintune (now obsolete), were in 1086 held by the Canons of
Wolverhampton under Sampson, the highly favoured royal Chaplain,
to whom the Conqueror had presented this fief.&nbsp; For the
purposes of comparison it may be mentioned that there were then
eighteen holdings in Staffordshire, occupying 567 hides, and
valued at about &pound;516.&nbsp; Sampson&rsquo;s fief extended
to 26&frac12; hides of this, and was estimated as being worth
&pound;8 2s. a year.</p>
<p>This Sampson, who has been incorrectly styled the first Dean
of Wolverhampton, was a Canon of Bayeux, and though a
king&rsquo;s chaplain, was not ordained a priest till nine years
after the Conqueror&rsquo;s death, when Rufus made him Bishop of
Worcester.&nbsp; Bishop Sampson subsequently gave the Church of
Wolverhampton to his Cathedral Monastery of Worcester.&nbsp; He
also held the neighbouring estates at Bilbrook and Tettenhall as
the superior of the priests of Tettenhall College.</p>
<p>Willenhall, in the great survey, is recorded to have
contained, as previously stated, three hides belonging to the
King, and two hides belonging to the church&mdash;a hide of land
in Saxon measurement was a variable quantity from 200 to 600
acres, according to <!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>the locality, but generally it was
accounted so much as would serve to maintain a
family&mdash;together with one acre of meadow, and a carucate
(which was a measure of about 100 acres of &ldquo;carved&rdquo;
land) employing three ploughs.&nbsp; The annual value of
Willenhall is set down at 20s.&nbsp; The population consisted of
eight families, or, as the return puts it, five bordars and three
villeins.</p>
<p>A bordar, or boor, was a squatter living in a hut or cottage
on the borders of a manor, having attached a little patch of
land, the rent of which was paid to the lord of the manor in the
shape of poultry, eggs, and small produce.&nbsp; A villein, or
serf, was to all intents and purposes a slave, at the absolute
disposal of the lord, except that he could not be detached from
the soil on which he was born.&nbsp; While the bordar, or
cottager, was resident in the manor more or less on sufferance,
the villein was there of right, and was in that sense the
superior of the bordar.&nbsp; The villein certainly might not go
away from Willenhall, nor get married, nor buy and sell oxen, nor
grind corn, without the express permission of the lord of the
manor; yet he was not so badly off as all this would make it
appear to our modern ideas.&nbsp; People seldom travelled in
those days, money was little used, life was exceedingly
primitive, and wants were very few and very simple.</p>
<p>Staffordshire at that time was in a chronic state of poverty,
an insurrection in the county having been suppressed in 1069 with
the Conqueror&rsquo;s customary severity, thousands of the
wretched hinds having been slaughtered, the county desolated and
the Midlands depopulated.</p>
<p>Bilston was but a cluster of mud huts inhabited by swineherds;
and it is probable Willenhall was a similar little centre of boor
life in the next woodland clearing a little further along the
purling brooklet, and near its junction with Beorgitha&rsquo;s
Stream, as the Tame was then called.&nbsp; The entire population
of the county was purely agrarian, the villeins and boors
altogether numbering about 2,800; or on an average of one
labourer to each 167 acres of land registered in Domesday
Book.&nbsp; The subsequent history of the two parts of Willenhall
will have to be traced separately.</p>
<p><!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>The two hides set down as ecclesiastical property have
remained in the possession of the church throughout.&nbsp;
Erdeswick, writing his history of this county in 1593, states
that within the jurisdiction of the Dean and Chapter of
Wolverhampton there were then &ldquo;nine several leets, whereof
eight belong to the church.&nbsp; The custos, lately called the
Dean, is lord of the borough of Wolverhampton, Codsall,
Hatherton, and Pelsall in com. Stafford; and of Lutley in com.

annum, and in the total is valued worth &pound;300 per annum.</p>

&pound;40&rdquo;&mdash;by no means a poor salary in those days
for such duties as the secretarial and managerial work to a
Chapter.</p>
<p>As to the three hides of Willenhall in the King&rsquo;s Manor
of Stow Heath, here is its later history as recorded by Dr.
Vernon, a historiographer who made some additions to Sampson
Erdeswick&rsquo;s history:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Willenhall is a manor called Stowheath,
with a court baron and court leet.&nbsp; Several lands there held
by copy from that lords thereof: four closes, called bundles,
held of this manor, and were, in 1729, confirmed by John, Lord
Gower, and Peter Giffard, lords of the manor of Stowheath; which
four closes, with four others, were sold about 1748 by Mr. Lane
to Admiral Anson, together with three tenements in Bloxwich, with
all the manor <!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>lands, tithes, hall, and park,
&amp;c., called Bentley, adjoining to Willenhall, for
&pound;13,500.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the adjoining hamlet, it may be mentioned that Domesday
Book formally recorded the canons of Wolverhampton to possess
&ldquo;five hides of Wednesfelde; the arable land is three
carucates; that there are six villeins, and six bordars, who have
six carucates; and that there is a wood in which cattle are
pastured, half a mile long and three furlongs broad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was life in Willenhall and Wednesfield at the Norman
period, both places being then overshadowed in more senses than
one by the severely protected royal preserves of Cannock
Forest.&nbsp; We may picture the few hinds constituting the
scanty population, tenanting cottages which were mere hovels, and
most of them like Gurth&mdash;the swineherd of Scott&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ivanhoe&rdquo;&mdash;wearing round their necks the iron
collars, which were the badge of Saxon serfdom, and like him
driving their herds into the woods each morning, and returning at
nightfall with their charges grunting and gorged with beech-mast
and acorns.</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
to their lowly dome<br />
The full-fed swine return&rsquo;d with evening home;<br />
Compell&rsquo;d reluctant, to the several sties,<br />
With din obstreperous, and ungrateful cries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trade and callings of an English serf were as limited as
his other opportunities in life; and others beside the swineherd
found it in the adjacent woodlands.&nbsp; For there were
certainly woodcutters and charcoal burners; and if the local iron
ore were exploited, who shall say there were not then Willenhall
smiths who fashioned bolts and bars, even if they had not arrived
at the intricacies of locks and keys?</p>
<p>Here we are but emerging from the twilight of history.</p>

32</span>VII.&mdash;A Chapel and a Chantry at Willenhall.</h2>
<p>In the earlier centuries of our national existence, the
history of a parish follows that of its church, the
ecclesiastical fold into which its inhabitants were regularly
gathered, not only for every religious purpose, but for every
other object of communal interest or of a public nature.</p>
<p>But, as previously explained, Willenhall was not a parish; it
was but one member of that wide parochial area ruled from the
mother church of Wolverhampton, several miles distant.</p>
<p>Yet at an early period Willenhall seems to have boasted a
chapel-of-ease, for the Calendar of Patent Rolls, under date
1297, contains an allusion to &ldquo;Thomas de Trollesbury,
parson of the church of Willenhale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dr. Oliver, in
his history of the town, says that Wolverhampton church was
rebuilt about 1342, and he evidently attributes the erection of
Willenhall chapel to the same date, as being the outcome of the
same devout spirit of church building.&nbsp; But this is nearly
half a century later than the allusion just quoted from the
Patent Rolls, and Dr. Oliver&rsquo;s reference may possibly be to
the founding of a chantry chapel by the Gerveyse family, who set
up one of these mass-houses in Willenhall about a dozen years
after one had been established at Pelsall.</p>
<p>Let it not be imagined that this new church was either a large
or a magnificent structure.&nbsp; In all probability it was a
diminutive chapel constructed of timber which had been cut in the
adjacent forest; some of its wall spaces, perhaps, were only of
timber framed wattle and dab; and at most any building material
of a more durable nature entering into its construction would be
but a plinth of stone masonry, and dwarfed at that.</p>
<p>A chapel-of-ease, be it explained, was often established where
the parish was a wide one, for the &ldquo;ease&rdquo; of those
parishioners who dwelt at a distance from the mother church, and
found it difficult to attend divine service so far away from
their homes.&nbsp; Such chapels were intended for prayer and
preaching only; burials <!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>and administrations of the sacraments
being always strictly reserved to the mother church.</p>
<p>While a chapel-of-ease was provided for the general good of
the whole community, a chantry chapel was intended for the
special glory and exclusive benefit of some local landed
family.&nbsp; And here is the first record we have of the
Willenhall Chantry; it is extracted from the Patent Rolls of
Edward III., under date 14th February, 1328:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Licence for the alienation in mortmain by Richard
Gerveyse, of Wolvernehampton, of a messuage, land, and a moiety
of a mill in Willenhale, co. Stafford, to a Chaplain to celebrate
Divine service daily in the Chapel of Willenhale for the souls of
the said Richard and Felicia, his wife, the fathers, mothers,
brothers, sisters, children and ancestors, and
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; A fine of 40s. was paid to the King (at
Stafford) for this licence to devote landed estate to the said
purposes of church endowment.</p>
<p>A chantry (or chauntry, a name derived from cantaria), was a
chapel, little church, or some particular altar in a church,
endowed with lands and other revenues, for the maintenance of a
priest, or priests, daily to chant a mass and offer prayers for
the souls of the donors, and such others as the founders of the
chantry may have named.&nbsp; In this particular instance, as we
have seen, the eternal welfare of the Gerveyses is sought to be
assured, and the chantry here was doubtless at the altar of the
new chapel-of-ease&mdash;we cannot expect there were two separate
ecclesiastical buildings in so small a place as Willenhall.</p>
<p>The method of procedure in setting up these foundations was
first to obtain a patent from the Crown for the founding and
endowing of them; and then to obtain the Bishop&rsquo;s licence
for the regular daily performance of Divine service by the
appointed chantry priest, to whose stipend and support the
endowment mainly went.</p>
<p>Most of these chantries came into existence in the 14th
century, and by the close of the following century there was
scarce a parish church in the kingdom without its chantry in one
or other of its side chapels or subsidiary altars.&nbsp; By the
time of <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Richard II.&mdash;about the year
1394&mdash;at least four chantries had been founded, and chapels
built, within the outer area of Wolverhampton parish; namely, at
Willenhall, Bilston, Pelsall, and Hatherton.</p>
<p>In connection with the endowments of the Willenhall chantry,
it is on record that at an Inquisition taken in 1397, it was
testified on oath that Roger Levison at that time held on lease
from Thomas Browning, chaplain of this chantry, 12 acres of land
in Wednesfield, and 100s. of rent in Willenhall, for which he had
to perform suit and service (of the usual nature in feudal
tenures) at the Deanery Court of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>In 1409 the advowson of the chapel of Willenhall, together
with certain valuable properties of rents and tenements in
Wolverhampton, were granted by Richard Hethe and William
Prestewode, chaplain, to William Bysshebury and his wife Joan,
and settled on them for the term of their lives, with remainder
to John Hampton, of Stourton, and his heirs for ever.</p>
<p>Fourteen years later William Bysshebury (his wife Joan being
then deceased) was sued by certain plaintiffs, on behalf of the
said John Hampton, for wasting these Wolverhampton properties, of
which he had the reversion.&nbsp; The plaintiffs included Roger
Aston, knight, William Leveson, William Everdon, Thomas
Arblaster, and others; while the waste and destruction complained
of comprised the digging and selling of clay, marl, and stones;
the permitting of seven halls, two chambers, two kitchens, two
granges, a dovecot, and a mill to remain unroofed till the
principal timbers had rotted; and also with cutting down and
selling a number of oaks, ashes, pear, and apple trees, the total
damage in respect of all this waste being estimated at a very
considerable figure.</p>
<p>The advowson was, of course, the right of presentation to the
benefice of Willenhall; and the Hamptons of Stourton Castle, to
whom it passed at this time, seem to have been a family which
originated at Wolverhampton&mdash;and perhaps derived their name
from the town.</p>
<p>The ministers who officiated in the local chapels-of-ease were
inferior in official status to the vicar, rector, or beneficed
clergyman <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>of the mother church, and such
curates were generally removable at the pleasure of the said
vicar or rector.&nbsp; Willenhall, doubtless, was served by a
&ldquo;curate&rdquo; sent from the Wolverhampton collegiate
establishment.</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward IV. local ecclesiastical matters became
further complicated by the collegiate church of Wolverhampton
being permanently united with the Deanery of Windsor, the two
deaneries being always subsequently held together.&nbsp; It
appears that King Edward, desirous of doing his Chaplain a
favour, annexed the &ldquo;Free Royal Church of
Wolverhampton&rdquo; to the said Deanery of Windsor, which royal
act was soon afterwards confirmed by Parliament (1480).</p>
<p>The Chantry of Willenhall, in common with all others,
disappeared at the Reformation (this one probably in 1545), when
prayers for the dead were no longer tolerated.&nbsp; But it is
interesting to observe that under the new Protestant
r&eacute;gime attendance at church every Sunday was still
regarded as a duty no good citizen and loyal subject could be
excused.</p>
<p>Attendance at church was compulsory in the early days of the
Anglican establishment.&nbsp; By statute (<span
class="smcap">i</span>, Elizabeth c. <span
class="smcap">i.</span>, 23 Elizabeth c. <span
class="smcap">i.</span>, and 3, James <span
class="smcap">i.</span> c. 4) every person was to repair to his
parish church every Sunday on pain of forfeiting 1s. for every
offence; and being present at any form of prayer contrary to the
Book of Common Prayer was punished with six months&rsquo;
imprisonment.&nbsp; Persons above sixteen years of age who
absented themselves from church above a month had to pay a
forfeit of &pound;20 a month.</p>
<p>Protestant dissenters who did not deny the doctrine of the
Trinity were (it is interesting to note) exempted from these
penalties in 1689; and the Roman Catholics were similarly
emancipated by law in 1792.&nbsp; This by the way.</p>
<p>It was in Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, and, of course, under the
authority of the newly-established Protestant Church of England,
that Willenhall was enabled to make a distinct advance in the
status of its church.&nbsp; The charge of this church became an
independent one, and was no longer subordinated to the canons of
Wolverhampton; <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the incumbent was thenceforward to be
in fact, as well as in name, &ldquo;Chaplain of
Willenhall.&rdquo;&nbsp; But although the incumbent thus obtained
his personal freedom from the domination of the mother church,
the Wolverhampton establishment still retained all the old
parochial rights in the shape of fees and ecclesiastical
emoluments.&nbsp; Beyond levying this money tribute, however, the
Dean and Rector of Wolverhampton no longer held any control over
the internal affairs of the church of St. Giles&rsquo;, in
Willenhall.&nbsp; The specified duties of the incumbent of
Willenhall (as set forth in a Trust deed of 1603, to which Sir
John Leveson is a party) were to conduct Divine service there,
and to have his residence within a mile and a half of the
church.</p>

<h2><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>VIII.&mdash;Willenhall in the Middle Ages.</h2>
<p>Having brought the ecclesiastical history of Willenhall up to
the enlightened days of Queen Elizabeth, to preserve some sort of
chronological arrangement, we leave that section awhile in order
to deal with the social life of the place, so far as this may be
gleaned from a number of fragmentary sources and isolated
references.</p>
<p>The result of these gleanings is naturally very scrappy an
disconnected&mdash;like the modern periodicals afflicted with the
prevalent &ldquo;snippetitis.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such as they are,
however, the local reader may be willing to accept them as being
of some little interest.</p>
<p>In the year 1172 the Pipe Rolls, which come next to the
Domesday Book among our most ancient national records, and
contain a full account of the Crown revenues, return Willenhall,
among five other Staffordshire estates, bringing in the sum of
&pound;19 7s. 8d. per annum to Henry II.&nbsp; This would
represent nowadays a sum twenty times that amount.&nbsp; These
estates were Bilston and Rowley Regis, being ancient demesnes of
the Crown, and the manors of Leek, Wolstanton, and Penkhull (in
the north of the county), which had escheated at the Conquest
from the Earl of Mercia.&nbsp; Rowley probably brought in but a
few pence at that time, when it formed a part of Clent.</p>
<p>In the same reign (Henry II.) the Canons of Wolverhampton are
recorded as holding two hides of land in
&ldquo;Winenhale&rdquo;&mdash;certainly not more than 400 acres
in a fertile locality like this.</p>
<p>During the reign of Edward III., his son and heir, the
renowned Black Prince, hero of Crecy and Poictiers, claimed
(after the manner of those times) the custody and guardianship of
Matilda, daughter and heiress of his old comrade in arms, John de
Willenhale.&nbsp; The heiress of Willenhall was therefore at this
time a royal ward.&nbsp; The earliest holder of this manor who is
known by his territorial title seems to be Roger de Wylnale, who
(according to Lawley&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Bilston,&rdquo; p.
132) was flourishing about the year 1109.</p>
<p><!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>In these earlier centuries of the Middle Ages the
machinery the law was crude and ineffective; as a consequence
lawlessness was rampant, and everywhere might became right.</p>
<p>The nobles, whenever the weakness of a king emboldened them,
fortified their castles, and increased the number of their
retainers, whom they reduced to a condition of complete
vassalage; and each baron strove to make himself a figure in the
great national convulsions which, from time to time, broke out
under the malign influences of the feudalism that dominated the
whole land and blighted its every hope of progress.</p>
<p>The Franklins, the inferior grade of gentry, who, under the
old Saxon system were called Thanes, were often compelled by
force of environment to range themselves under the protecting
banner of one or other of these petty kings.&nbsp; And where
authority was systematically set at defiance by the great and the
powerful, inoffensive conduct and dutiful obedience to the laws
of the land afforded no guarantee for the security of either life
or property.</p>
<p>To these disturbing influences must be added the barbarous
severity of the laws of the chase, the vindictive nature of which
sometimes made the heavy feudal chains of the common people
almost too grievous to be borne.&nbsp; As Willenhall was on the
confines of the Royal Forest of Cannock, the oppressive nature of
the Forest Laws was not unfelt by the inhabitants of this
secluded hamlet.</p>
<p>In 1306, when John de Swynnerton married the daughter and
heiress of Philip de Montgomery, Seneschal of the Royal Forest of
Cannock, and became Steward of the Forest in customary
succession, Willenhall was officially returned, along with a
number of surrounding places (Wednesfield, Wednesbury, Darlaston,
Essington, Hilton, Newbrigge, Moseley, Bushbury, Pendeford,
Coven, and a score more), as appurtenant to a third part of the
said forest bailiwick.</p>
<p>The Swynnerton interest in Willenhall transpires again in
1364, when John de Swynnerton is found suing two Willenhall men
for forcibly and feloniously removing some of his goods and
chattels from that place.</p>
<p><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>In the previous reign&mdash;that of Henry
III.&mdash;numerous fines for illegal enclosures of Cannock
Forest had been imposed upon landowners in this locality.&nbsp;
Among them were Stephen de Hulton (or Hilton), and John, his son,
&ldquo;of Wednesfield,&rdquo; who had enclosed with a hedge and a
ditch three acres of heath in Wednesfield, which they held under
the Dean of Wolverhampton.&nbsp; They were fined four shillings
each, and ordered peremptorily to throw down the hedge.</p>
<p>Here is an episode characteristic of the period.&nbsp; It is a
Tuesday evening in the month of August, 1347, and about the hour
of vespers.&nbsp; The scene is laid in &ldquo;the field of
Wolverhampton, called Wyndefield, in a place called Le Ocstele,
near Le More Love-ende.&rdquo;&nbsp; A body of men, all carrying
arms, are seen to approach their victim, who is described as a
clerk, and therefore presumably defenceless.&nbsp; He is Roger
Levessone, son of Richard Levessone.&nbsp; His assailants are
Robert le Clerk, of Sedgley, two Dudley men, a man from Bloxwich,
and several others, all duly named in the records of the law
courts.</p>
<p>What the cause of quarrel may have been these meagre records
do not inform us, but on the evidence of a number of witnesses,
among whom was Richard Colyns, of Willenhall, they freely used
their spears and swords, inflicting wounds upon the throat and
other parts of the body, till the unfortunate Roger was
despatched.</p>
<p>In 1339, one Richard Adams, of Willenhall, was charged with
slaying two men in that place, one a townsman named John Odyes,
and a certain John de Bentley.&nbsp; As he was acquitted,
probably he did it in self-defence.&nbsp; Encounters of this
character were of frequent occurrence in those lawless times.</p>
<p>When the offences recorded are of a less serious nature than
murder and slaughter, they are nearly always described as being
accompanied by the violent use of lethal weapons&mdash;&ldquo;vi
et armis&rdquo; is the old legal phrase.&nbsp; Here are some
examples of this kind of lawlessness:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1352, William de Hampton (probably of the Dunstall family
of that name) prosecuted a gang of fourteen men, including <!--
page 40--><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>a chaplain, the parson of Sheynton (?&nbsp; Shenstone),
and two men from Tettenhall, for robbing him of his goods and
chattels at Willenhall, Wednesfield, Tettenhall, and
Pendeford.&nbsp; Of the details of the robberies we are able to
learn nothing, except that they were all perpetrated forcibly,
and with a reckless display of violence.</p>
<p>A similar prosecution was undertaken in 1395 by another member
of this family, one Nicholas Hampton, against Thomas Marshall, of
Willenhall, and for a similar outrage in that place.</p>
<p>A Willenhall man named John Wilson, in 1373, had to invoke the
law upon a desperado who forcibly broke into his house and close
at Homerwych (Hammerwich), and stole from thence timber,
household utensils, clothing, corn, hay, and apparently
everything he could lay his hands upon and carry away.</p>
<p>Twenty years later John Wilson (probably the same prosecutor)
charged John Wilkes, of Darlaston, with stealing two of his oxen,
though no violence is alleged on this occasion.</p>
<p>Two Willenhall men, William Colyns, and William Stokes, were,
in 1399, arrested, and charged with cutting down trees and
underwood at Bentley.&nbsp; Force and violence were used on that
occasion; and it must be remembered that timber was then in much
greater demand for building purposes than now, while underwood
was in constant requisition as fuel and for the repair of fences
and shelters.</p>
<p>Sixteen years later (1415) John Pype and a number of other
Bilston men were prosecuted by Sir Hugh Burnell, Knt., for
breaking into his closes at Willenhall, trespassing on his land,
and treading down his grass with their cattle, committing damage
to a grievous extent, and all in undisguised defiance to the
law.</p>
<p>Enough has been quoted to illustrate, by incidents common to
the social life of so simple a community as that of Willenhall,
the gradual decay of feudalism, and the steady growth of English
liberty by the vindication of constitutional law.</p>
<h2><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>IX.&mdash;The Levesons and other old Willenhall
families.</h2>
<p>From the same sources, namely from the records of the ancient
Law Courts, as transcribed, translated, and published in the
volumes of the Salt Society, we are enabled to gain a knowledge
of the most prominent families in this locality during the Middle
Ages.&nbsp; There seem to have been lawsuits ever since there
were landowners.</p>
<p>The principal family in Willenhall were the Levesons or
Leusons, who are said to have been connected with this place and
the neighbouring parishes of Wednesbury and Wolverhampton, almost
from the time of the Norman Conquest, eking out a living from the
soil, of which their tenure was at first a very precarious
one.</p>
<p>Their pedigree, given by the county historian, Shaw (II. p.
169), shows the founder to be one Richard Leveson, settled in
Willenhall in the reign of Edward I.&nbsp; But we find that in
the year before this king&rsquo;s accession, namely, in 1271,
Richard Levison paid a fine of 2s. 3d. in the Forest Court for
being permitted to retain in cultivation an assart of half an
acre, lying in Willenhall; that is, to be allowed to continue
under the plough a piece of land on which he had grubbed up all
the trees and bushes by the roots, to the detriment of the covert
within the King&rsquo;s Royal Forest of Cannock.</p>
<p>The founder of the family was succeeded by a son, and by a
grandson, both of whom were also called &ldquo;Richard Leveson,
of Willenhall,&rdquo; although the last one was sometimes
designated as &ldquo;of Wolverhampton,&rdquo; to which town he
was doubtless attracted by the greater profits to be made in the
wool trade.</p>
<p>The early commercial fame of Wolverhampton was based on this
industry.&nbsp; Although there were no wool-staplers here in
1340, yet in 1354, when the wool staple was removed from
Flanders, Wolverhampton was one of the few English towns fixed
upon by Parliament for carrying on the trade.&nbsp; (A staple, it
may be <!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>explained, is a public mart appointed
and regulated by law.)&nbsp; Although the staple was again
changed to Calais, it was speedily brought back to England, and
the Levesons were soon among the foremost &ldquo;merchants of the
staple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Clement de Willenhale is mentioned in an Assize of the year
1338, but not improbably he was identical with the Clement
Leveson mentioned in another lawsuit in 1356, a party to which
was a member of the ancient local family of
Harper&mdash;&ldquo;John le Harpere,&rdquo; as he is therein
called.</p>
<p>Then there is mention in 1351 of the John de Willenhale, who
is described as being in the wardship of the Prince of
Wales.&nbsp; But perhaps the best insight into the social state
of Willenhall at this period will be obtained from a
consideration of its inhabitants liable to pay a war tax which
was levied by Edward III. in order to enable him to carry on a
war of defence against Scotland.&nbsp; For this popular military
expedition, Parliament in 1327 granted the youthful king a
Subsidy to the amount of one-twentieth leviable upon the value of
nearly all kinds of property.&nbsp; Assessors and collectors were
appointed for every town and village, and they were sworn to make
true returns of every man&rsquo;s goods and chattels, both in the
house and out of it.&nbsp; The exceptions allowable were the
goods of those whose total property did not amount to the full
value of ten shillings; the tools of trade; and the implements of
agriculture.&nbsp; On the face of it, these exemptions seem fair
and just to the lower orders; but we find the higher orders were
also favoured, and unduly so; not so much perhaps in the matters
of armour and cavalry horses, as in the non-liability of the
robes and jewels of knights, gentlemen, and their wives, as well
as of their silver and household plate.</p>

<p>It will be seen that this fragment is imperfect, as the
various amounts set down will not add up to the
&ldquo;summa&rdquo; or total given, notwithstanding that it has
been audited&mdash;the abbreviation &ldquo;Pb.&rdquo; standing
for probata, or proved.</p>
<p>But more interest will be found in a brief study of the names
of Willenhall&rsquo;s inhabitants, who were men of substance
seven hundred years ago.</p>
<p>It will be observed that Simon is the only member of the
Leveson family assessed, and that he pays the least sum, except
that paid by the man Hugh, described as &ldquo;the
Gardener&rdquo; (the amount paid by &ldquo;John the Baker&rdquo;
has been obliterated from the roll).</p>
<p>The strange surname Odyes, appearing twice in this list,
occurs in another record of the year 1422, and seems to belong to
a gentle family, resident in Willenhall, and owning lands in
Bentley.</p>
<p>As but few people then bore recognised surnames, we find
taxpayers here officially set down as &ldquo;Richard the son of
Ralph,&rdquo; &ldquo;John the son of Roger,&rdquo; &ldquo;Richard
the son of Adam,&rdquo; and <!-- page 44--><a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;William the son of Robert.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides
these named according to their parentage, we have those described
according to their place of residence; as thus, &ldquo;Andrew at
the Mere,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Adam at the Mere&rdquo;; &ldquo;Agnes
at the Wood,&rdquo; and &ldquo;William at the Pear
Tree.&rdquo;&nbsp; William Newman was probably so-called because
he was a new-comer, or was lately emancipated from serfdom as a
&ldquo;new man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Patent Rolls of November, 1334, may be gleaned the
bare facts of what seems to have been an extraordinary assault at
Willenhall, which was committed upon John, son of John de
Bentley, by no less than thirty assailants.&nbsp; Among those
implicated may be noted the names of five members of the Leveson
family, namely, Geoffrey, Moses, John, Simon, and Simon the
younger; also the names of William, son of Robert atte Pirie,
Andrew atte Mere, John le Harpere, Richard Coletes, Richard
Colyns, and several others which have occurred before in these
pages.&nbsp; The Leveson family continue to make many appearances
in the records of Willenhall litigation at this early
period.&nbsp; In 1347, Andrew, the son of Simon Levesone, of
Willenhale, was sued for the treading down and consuming of the
corn of Andrew in le Lone at Willenhale, with his cattle, and by
force of arms, and for cutting down his trees, and beating and
wounding his servant.</p>
<p>In the following year, Geoffrey Levesone, of Willenhale,
brought a somewhat similar charge of trespass against John
Oldejones, of Wodnesfeld.&nbsp; In 1362, Roger Levesone, of
Willenhale, was successful in a suit for recovering two acres of
land at Wolverhampton.&nbsp; About the same time Juliana
Levesone, of Willenhall, married William Tomkys, a member of one
of the leading families of Bilston.</p>
<p>In 1369, John de la Lone, of Wolverhampton, sued John
Levesone, of Willenhale, for forcibly taking his fish, to the
value of 100 shillings, &ldquo;from his several fishery in
Willenhale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1394, Roger Liefson (Leveson), of Wylenhale (who has been
previously mentioned in Chapter VII.), was at law with Thomas
Colyns, of the same place, for forcibly taking away from
Willenhall twelve oxen belonging to him.&nbsp; Immediately after,
one William de Chorley was attacked for taking away from Great
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>Wyrley, also with a display of armed force, three oxen
and two cows, the property of Richard Leveson, of
Willenhall.&nbsp; If these two cases were not reprisals, they at
least show a state of disturbance and insecurity.</p>
<p>Another exhibition of lawlessness is brought to our notice in
1429, when Richard Leveson is found suing Robert Dorlaston,
weaver, Richard Colyns, lorymer, William Brugge, and William
Bate, yeomen, all described as &ldquo;of Wylenhale,&rdquo; for
violently and forcibly breaking into his close at Willenhall.</p>
<p>A similar case of forcible entry into the close and houses of
James Leveson, at Willenhale, by one Roger Waters, a Willenhale
lorymer, was an outrage which occupied the attention of the law
courts in 1433.</p>
<p>Three years later (1436) another law case shows the same James
Levesson suing John Pippard, chaplain, for a messuage and 20
acres of land in Wolverhampton, which he asserted had descended
to him from Richard Levesson, of Willenhall, who held it in the
time of Edward I., in a direct line, namely, from Richard to his
son Geoffrey, from Geoffrey to his son Roger, and from Roger to
his son Nicholas, who was plaintiff&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>By this time the Leveson family seems to have been not only
firmly established in and around Willenhall, Wednesfield, and
Wolverhampton, but to have been very numerous as well.&nbsp;
Originally yeomen of the first-named place, cultivating their
lands within the precincts of the Royal Forest of Cannock, they
gradually grew and prospered, one branch taking advantage of the
greater commercial opportunities offered by the last-named town,
and settling there as merchants and wool-staplers.</p>
<p>Woolstapling was a prosperous trade in Wolverhampton as early
as 1354; and in its ancient market place the Levesons of the
younger branch were to be found bartering wool and steadily
accumulating riches until they were able to marry into the most
exclusive of the county families.</p>
<p>Among the Bailiffs of the Staple&mdash;which, in the case of
Wolverhampton were wool and woolfel&mdash;we find the names of
William Leveson in 1485, and Walter Leveson in 1491.</p>
<p><!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>Members of other old and well-known local families also
filled this office of Bailiff at various times, namely, William
Jennings in 1483, Richard Gough in 1486, Edward Giffard in 1493,
Y. Turton in 1496, and W. Wrottesley in 1499.&nbsp; If evidence
were required of the enterprise of these Wolverhampton merchants,
it would be forthcoming in the fact that a Leveson and a
Jennings, both natives of this place (the latter a
&ldquo;merchant taylor&rdquo; in 1508) filled the high office of
Lord Mayor of London.</p>
<p>An Inquisition Post Mortem (one of those feudal inquiries into
the extent of a man&rsquo;s landed possessions which passed to
his heirs) was held on the death of Henry Beaumont, lord of the
Manor of Wednesbury, at Willenhall, on 28th June, 1472.&nbsp;
Among those sworn of the jury on that occasion were James Leveson
Esq., Richard Leveson, Esq., Cornelius Wyrley, Esq., Robert
Leveson, Ralph Busshbury, Esq., and William Mollesley, all local
magnates.</p>
<p>It has not been possible to identify all the members of this
extensive family.&nbsp; There were two distinct branches of the
Levesons or Luesons.&nbsp; The elder line were of Prestwood and
Lilleshall, and produced Sir Richard Leveson, of Trentham; the
younger branch, descended from William, the son of Richard
Leveson, of Willenhall, produced the Sir Thomas Leveson who was
the Royalist governor of Dudley Castle during the great Civil War
(1643).</p>
<p>The elder line were &ldquo;of Prestwood&rdquo; because
Nicholas Leveson, in the time of Henry VI. married Maud, heiress
of John de Prestwood.&nbsp; The Lilleshall and other properties
were fat church lands, purchased by the wealthy Levesons at the
Dissolution of the Monasteries.&nbsp; It was a Richard Leveson of
the Prestwood branch who acquired the Haling Estate in Kent by
marriage with a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s daughter, and died in 1539
after being himself Lord Mayor of London.</p>
<p>Also from this branch came the famous Vice-Admiral of England
in Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; This gallant sea-dog,
whose romance with the &ldquo;Spanish Lady&rdquo; has been retold
by the present writer in his &ldquo;Staffordshire Stories&rdquo;
(pp. 22&ndash;35), took part in that <!-- page 47--><a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>daring attack
upon Cadiz which has been sung by Henry John Newbolt in his
&ldquo;Admirals All&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Essex was fretting in Cadiz Bay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With the galleons fair in sight;<br />
Howard at last must give him his way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the word was passed to fight.<br />
Never was schoolboy gayer than he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Since holidays first began:<br />
He tossed his bonnet to wind and sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And under the guns he ran.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Admiral Leveson&rsquo;s effigy in Wolverhampton Church stamps
him as one of the heroes of old romance&mdash;his career was
indeed remarkable, as may be read in the work alluded to.</p>
<p>The present-day representatives of the family are the
Leveson-Gowers, the head of whom is the Duke of Sutherland.&nbsp;
The Gowers were an Anglo-Saxon family seated in Yorkshire, and
the union of the two occurred about the time of Charles I., when
Sir Thomas Gower, then Sheriff of Yorkshire, married Frances,
daughter and co-heir of Sir John Leveson, of Haling and
Lilleshall.</p>
<p>At the time Richard Leveson was sailing the seas with Essex
and Drake, there was a John Leveson living in Willenhall as lord
of the manor, the site of his residence being still marked by the
position of Levison Street and Moat Street.</p>
<p>In Wolverhampton &ldquo;Turton&rsquo;s Old Hall&rdquo; was
originally known as Leveson&rsquo;s Hall; this massive old
mansion, surrounded by its once deep and wide moat, is believed
to have been erected by John Leveson, a wool merchant, who was
High Sheriff of Staffordshire in 1561.</p>
<p>Truly the local record of the Levesons is a long and notable
one; and it is interesting to note that John Leveson, son of
Thomas, who had been Sheriff of the county, and died in 1595, is
the last in Shaw&rsquo;s pedigree to be described as &ldquo;of
Willenhale,&rdquo; although in a succeeding chapter we shall find
members of this family still seated on their native soil,
Willenhall, as late as the years of the Jacobite Rebellions, 1715
and 1745.</p>

48</span>X.&mdash;Willenhall Endowments at the Reformation.</h2>
<p>Now to resume the ecclesiastical history of the place.&nbsp;
Willenhall was affected by the Reformation from two directions;
first, through the mother church of Wolverhampton, of which
collegiate establishment it formed a portion; secondly, through
its own chapel and the endowed chantry established therein.</p>
<p>The great ecclesiastical upheaval of the sixteenth century had
its precursor in the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry
VIII.&nbsp; The rumble of the coming storm warned the secular or
non-monastic foundations that it would be prudent to set their
houses in order if they were to safeguard their revenues; for
every one of the smaller monasteries, with an income of less than
&pound;200 per annum, had been forfeited to the Crown (1529).</p>
<p>A new valuation of the College of Wolverhampton had but just
been instituted in 1526, from which it will be necessary here to
extract only that portion of the return relating to our
subject.&nbsp; It was to this effect:&mdash;</p>

49</span>The value of the Deanery, the Prebends, and the two
Chantries of Willenhall and Bilston are all set forth in this
Return.&nbsp; (See Oliver&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Wolverhampton
Church,&rdquo; pp. 57&ndash;60.)</p>
<p>The visitation of the religious houses, undertaken as it was
in a hostile spirit by Henry VIII., naturally alarmed the
authorities of a church where it would appear that irregularities
on the part of the prebendaries had long existed, and not an
inconsiderable portion of the church property had been alienated,
to say nothing of the sequestration of the church communion
plate.&nbsp; Now some hasty attempts were made at restitution,
and more so to escape detection and censure.</p>
<p>Restoration in some sort seems to have been hastily attempted
at Wolverhampton.&nbsp; In 1529 Nicholas Leveson presented a new
chalice of silver; and the high altar was restored at much
expense to its former magnificence.&nbsp; The Dean, however, fell
into disgrace in the matter of denying the King&rsquo;s
supremacy, and was committed to the Tower of London in
consequence.&nbsp; In 1540 bells purchased by the inhabitants
from Wenlock Abbey were hung in the church tower.&nbsp; Four
years later sixteen stalls, taken from the recently dissolved
monastery at Lilleshall, were presented by Sir Walter Leveson to
Wolverhampton Church.</p>
<p>All these precautions scarcely availed to avert the impending
doom.&nbsp; By an Act passed in the first year of the reign of
Edward VI., the dissolution of Colleges and Chantries was
effected.&nbsp; But the Royal College of Windsor, of which
Wolverhampton was a member, was especially exempted, and the
Wolverhampton Chapter consequently felt secure from
disturbance.</p>
<p>So sure of their position were they that the prebendaries
actually proceeded to lease out their property.&nbsp; Among the
others, the prebendary of Willenhall granted his lands and tithes
to John Leveson, Esq. (who held several other of the prebendal
properties), for a reserved rent of &pound;6 6s.</p>
<p>Although the various deeds were confirmed by the Dean and
Chapter of Windsor, the legality of the proceedings was
questioned; and presently it was successfully contended that the
Deanery of Wolverhampton was a separate benefice detached from
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>the College of Windsor, and that the prebends were in
the hands of the Crown.</p>
<p>There is extant another valuation of these ecclesiastical
revenues in the Primate&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp; The record is in
Latin, but it may be Englished thus:&mdash;</p>

as that of the Reformation was made in 1551, and one item in

<p>The Chantry, being regarded as one of the abhorred
institutions of Romanism, thus came to an end under the reforming
zeal of our Protestant legislators in the early years of the
reign of Edward VI.</p>
<p>All the possessions of the Colleges of Wolverhampton and
Tettenhall, with their Prebends, together with the Chantry lands
of Willenhall, Bilston, and Kinver, when they passed from the
Crown in 1552, fell into the hands of the notorious John Dudley,
Duke of Northumberland, who contrived to grab no end of church
property in this immediate locality.&nbsp; When Northumberland
came to the block shortly afterwards, there was a great
redistribution of this property, that of Wolverhampton being once
more annexed to the Royal Free Chapel of St. George at
Windsor.</p>
<h2><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>XI.&mdash;How the Reformation Affected Willenhall.</h2>
<p>As recorded in the last chapter, the Willenhall Chantry, in
common with all others throughout the country, was finally
suppressed by Edward VI. and his Protestant ministers
(1547).&nbsp; It had been in existence upwards of 200 years, the
name of its first Chantry Priest being given (1341) as
&ldquo;William in the Lone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prebendal lands also, as we have seen, were leased in the
fourth year of this reign to John Leveson, for the sum of
&pound;6 6s. per annum.&nbsp; All the other lands belonging to
the Deanery of Wolverhampton then passed into the hands of the
King, but did not long remain in the Crown, being conveyed, with
much more ecclesiastical property hereabouts, to John Dudley,
Duke of Northumberland.&nbsp; On his attainder in the reign of
Mary (1553), the Deanery lands reverted to the Crown, to be again
restored to their original use by that most pious queen.</p>
<p>In 1547 the zeal of the Protestant reformers induced the
Government of Edward VI. to send Commissioners round the country
to make inquiry in every parish and every church as to the
ecclesiastical appointments used in ritual, with orders to
suppress all that made for &ldquo;idolatrous Popish
practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commissioners for this locality were all men of high
standing in the county, as will be seen from their names.&nbsp;
They were sworn to make&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A juste, treu, and parfett survey and inventorie
of all goods, plate, juelles, vestements, belles, and other
ornaments, of all churches, chappells, brotherhoddes, gyldes,
fraternities, and compones within the Hundred of Offeley, in the
Countie of Stafford; taken the seventh day of October, in the
sixte yere of the Rayne of our Sovereyn Lord, King Edward the
Sixte, by Thomas Gyffard and Thomas Fytzherbert, knyghts; and
Walter Wrottesley, Esquier, by virtue of the King&rsquo;s
commissein to them, directed in that behalf, as hereafter
particularly appereth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>On one hand, they had to put a stop to the embezzlement,
concealment, and appropriation by private persons of the
condemned church property, and to recover as much of it as
possible for the King&rsquo;s Exchequer.&nbsp; For, under
pretence of a burning zeal for the reformed faith, there had been
much sacrilegious spoliation&mdash;church plate finding its way
on to the table of the neighbouring gentry, marble coffins being
utilised as horse-troughs, altar cloths serving as tapestry for
parlour walls, and similar malpractices by those who ought to
have known better.&nbsp; This property was to be retrieved, and
the detected offenders were to be heavily fined.</p>
<p>The Return made for Willenhall Church by the Commissioners and
their official &ldquo;Surveyor,&rdquo; or assessor, runs,
verbatim:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="smcap">Wylnall</span>.</p>
<p>Fyrste one challes of sylver with a paten parcell gilte

delyvered unto Richard Forsett, Surveyor to the Kynge&rsquo;s
Majesti, as shall appare by his acquytance, except ij belles the

</blockquote>
<p>A few words in explanation of the above terms may, perhaps, be
necessary for the general reader.&nbsp; The chalice and the paten
were the vessels used at the Sacrament, the former being the wine
cup, which was of silver, and the latter the bread dish, partly
gilt.&nbsp; The priestly vestments were those forbidden by the
reformed church, and were of different textures for different
parts of the Roman ceremonial; the fustian was a coarse piled
fabric, or kind of cotton velvet, imported from the East;
chamlett, or camlett, was a cloth so called because originally
woven from camel hair; and the sarsnett was a thin kind of
silk.&nbsp; The altar cloths had to be discarded when the
&ldquo;Mass&rdquo; was reformed into the &ldquo;Holy <!-- page

54</span>Communion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The cruets were pairs of metal
jars for containing the wine and the water previous to their
admixture in the sacrament of the Mass.&nbsp; The bucket was for
use at the font.&nbsp; The candle-sticks were for the lighted
tapers upon the altar and in this case were made of maslin, an
alloy like brass, but with a harder grain; latten, of which the
altar lamp was made, was a similar alloy resembling brass.&nbsp;
The pax was a tablet (sometimes of wood, sometimes of bread,
though this Willenhall example was of durable brass), on which
was a figure of the crucifixion; it was presented in the ceremony
of the Mass for the faithful to kiss.&nbsp; The Corporas was the
cloth placed beneath the consecrated elements in the service of
the Mass.&nbsp; The towels were napkins used in the celebration
of the sacred office; it must be borne in mind that all textile
fabrics, as well as metals, were far more costly in those days,
and the chest was to keep all these valuables in safety.</p>
<p>It is difficult to decide the nature of the &ldquo;two small
bells&rdquo;; because, if they were the sanctus bells used at the
most solemn parts in the performance of the Mass, one a hand-bell
rung inside, and the other as a signal outside, they would have
been abolished.&nbsp; So, as they were left by the Reformers,
they were probably small bells in the steeple or turret.</p>
<p>So much for the changes materialistic brought about at this
great religious upheaval of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; Now let
us inquire into the more serious and essential changes which
occurred in the religious life of the nation at that time.</p>
<p>From a little known Return made in 1586 we are enabled to
gather the conditions of the Church of England, as it was found
to exist, only 28 years after it had been by law established.</p>
<p>At the Reformation, after the annulling of all &ldquo;Popish
ordinations,&rdquo; the state of the English clergy became very
deplorable.&nbsp; Some of the basest of the people were permitted
to become parish priests, a circumstance that gave point to the
arguments and contentions of the Puritans.</p>
<p>The Reformers were divided upon the subject, Queen Elizabeth
expressing herself as being perfectly satisfied if in each county
three or four clergymen could be found capable of <!-- page
55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>preaching to their congregations.&nbsp; The Puritans, on
the other hand, laid great stress on the admonitory value and
spiritual importance of sermons and homilies.</p>
<p>By 1586 the condition of the newly-formed Protestant Church of
England had become so scandalous in respect of its priesthood
that a national &ldquo;Survey&rdquo; was undertaken.&nbsp; Of the
remarkable facts disclosed by this Return we select from the
summaries the following few which relate to this immediate
locality:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Wolverhampton</span>.&mdash;A
Collegiate Church; impropriate to the King&rsquo;s Majestie or
the Dean of Windsor; value of lands belonging to it is &pound;600
per annum.&nbsp; There be seven Prebends and a Sexton under them;
seven stipendiaries; the allowance for four of them is ten nobles
apiece; for the other three &pound;6 apiece.&nbsp; Six of the
Prebends be held by Sir Gualter Levison; the other is held by
another.&nbsp; The rent reserved to the Dean of Windsor,
&pound;38.&nbsp; People 4,000.&nbsp; Many Popish; many
Recusants.</p>
<p>Chappells 3:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Pelsall; curate&rsquo;s stipend &pound;4; no
preacher.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Willenhall; curate hath no stipend reserved; no
preacher.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Bilston; curate hath no stipend reserved; no
preacher.</p>
<p>These curates, especially two of them, Mounsell and Cooper, be
notorious and dissolute men.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the lamentable state of the local clergy at that
time, when the population of Wolverhampton, with all its outlying
parts, is set down at 4,000 only.&nbsp; A few words of
explanation will perhaps be necessary to make the foregoing
extract more intelligible to the general reader.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;noble&rdquo; was a coin of the value of 6s. 8d.; a
&ldquo;recusant&rdquo; was one who disputed the authority and
supremacy of the Crown in matters ecclesiastical, whether Papist
or Puritan; while to &ldquo;impropriate&rdquo; church property
was to place it in the hands of a layman.</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Four or five more extracts from this interesting Survey,
relating to other parts of this neighbourhood, may not be out of
place to quote here:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span
class="smcap">Byshby</span>.&mdash;Parsonage, impropriate; worth
&pound;40 per annum; vicarage worth &pound;30; patron, Sir Edward
Littleton; many Popish; many Recusants.&nbsp; Incumbent a mere
worldling; no preacher.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Tetnall</span>.&mdash;A college dissolved;
five prebends and a deane; impropriate to the King&rsquo;s
Majestie; worth 300 marks.&nbsp; One prebend is held by Sir
Richard Leveson; one by Mr. Gualter Wriotesley; two by Richard

to the vicars of Lichfield; worth &pound;20; vicarage worth as
much; patrons, the Vicars of Lichfield.&nbsp; Vicar &mdash;; no
preacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This selection of extracts will serve to enlighten the reader
upon two important points in the history of the Church; the first
is the amount of church revenue which had already found its way
into the pockets of the laity; and the other is the lamentable
necessity there was at that period to provide the English clergy
with ready-made Homilies.&nbsp; These Homilies were ordered (as
the Prayer Book informs us, in the XXXV. Article), to be read
&ldquo;diligently and distinctly&rdquo; in the churches by the
Ministers.</p>
<h2><!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>XII.&mdash;Before the Reformation&mdash;and After.</h2>
<p>It may be assumed that Willenhall Church has been dedicated to
St. Giles from the first, because the period for holding the
dedicatory Wake synchronises with St. Gile&rsquo;s day (September
1st), making allowance for the eleven days&rsquo; difference
effected in 1752 between the Old Style and the New Style
calendars.&nbsp; As the Protestant Reformers took objection to
non-Biblical saints (West Bromwich Church was altered from St.
Clement&rsquo;s to All Saints&rsquo;), a dedication to St. Giles
may safely be accepted as a pre-Reformation one; and as St. Giles
was the patron saint of cripples, he doubtless retained his
popularity here on account of the reputation for healing
qualities acquired by the Willenhall &ldquo;Holy
Well&rdquo;&mdash;of which more anon.&nbsp; But in addition to
its Wake, the town seems to have possessed in medi&aelig;val
times a much frequented Summer Fair, held on Trinity
Sunday.&nbsp; Our knowledge of this interesting fact is derived
from the records of the Court of Star Chamber.</p>
<p>This court was established by Henry VII. to deal with routs,
riots, and all other cases not sufficiently provided for by the
common law; but the oppression practised by the unscrupulous
abuse of its indefinite jurisdiction led to its summary
extinction in the reign of Charles I.</p>
<p>The case to be quoted is one of an alleged riot in the year
1498 (13 Henry VII.), in which the men of Wednesbury were deeply
involved.&nbsp; These turbulent townsmen seem to have made
themselves notorious for riotous behaviour at various times; as
witness the historic Wesley Riots of 1744, their march on
Birmingham to regulate the price of malt in 1782, and their
attack on the same town during the Church and King Riots in
1791.</p>
<p>It would appear that a company of Mummers, made up of
performers from Wolverhampton, Wednesbury, and Walsall, were
regularly in the habit of going round to the neighbouring Fairs,
and performing to the accompaniment of pipe and tabor a
Morris-dance, in which the characters were dressed up for the
then <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>popular dramatic interlude of &ldquo;Robin Hood,&rdquo;
including Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, and all the rest of them.</p>
<blockquote><p>The hobby-horse doth hither prance,<br />
Maid Marian and the Morris-dance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to discover why, in this local
version, the character called the &ldquo;Abbot of Marham&rdquo;
was introduced into the play&mdash;Marham nunnery was situated in
Norfolk, a long way from the usual forest scenes of Sherwood and
Needwood.</p>
<p>The money collected at these al fresco performances was
applied to maintaining the fabric of the three parish churches;
but, for some reason unknown, there had evidently grown up a
deadly feud between the Wednesbury and the Walsall
contingents.&nbsp; This was the cause of all the trouble.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;John Beamont&rdquo; mentioned was John Beaumont,
Esquire, lord of the manor of Wednesbury, a benefactor of the
parish church there, and a patron of a Walsall Chantry.&nbsp; It
will be noticed that the quoted document speaks of the
&ldquo;Church of the lordship,&rdquo; not &ldquo;of the
parish&rdquo;; and also, that the prefix &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; was
then used to a parson&rsquo;s name, as we should now use the
prefix &ldquo;Rev.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is the text of the plaints entered by the terrorised
&ldquo;orators&rdquo; of Walsall, together with the affidavits
put in as rejoinders; the archaic spelling is retained only in a
few places just to indicate the style of English then employed in
the law courts; and it is interesting to note that Midlanders had
those peculiar vowel sounds in olden times, and pronounced
&ldquo;fetch&rdquo; as &ldquo;fatch,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;gather&rdquo; as &ldquo;gether&rdquo;&mdash;just as the
illiterate among them still do:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">To the King Our Sovereign
Lord</span>&mdash;</p>
<p>Humbly sheweth unto your highness, your faithful subject and
true liegeman, Roger Dyngley, Mayor of Walsall; and Thomas Rice,
of the same town&mdash;That whereas your said orators on
Wednesday next before Trinity Sunday, the 13th year of your
reign, were in God&rsquo;s peace and yours, in your said town of
Walsall&mdash;thither came one John Cradeley, of Wednesbury, and
Thomas Morres, of Dudley, in your said <!-- page 59--><a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>county; and
then and there made affray upon the said Thomas Rice, &ldquo;and
hym soore wounded and bett&rdquo; [beat], so that he was in peril
of his life.</p>
<p>Whereupon the said Mayor, with other inhabitants, did arrest
John Cradeley and Thomas Morres, and there did put them in prison
according to your laws, there to remain till it were known
whether the said Thomas Rice should live or die.</p>
<p>And incontinent thereupon one John Beamonde,
&ldquo;Squyer,&rdquo; Walter Levison, of Wolverhampton, Richard
Foxe, priest, of the same town, and one Robert Marshall, of
Wednesbury, &ldquo;arreysed&rdquo; and riotously assembled
themselves at Wednesbury with other riotous persons to the number
of 200 men, arrayed in manner of war, that is to say, with bows,
arrows, bills, and &ldquo;gleves&rdquo; [long daggers], with
other unlawful weapons there gathered and assembled, to the
intent to have come to have destroyed your said town of Walsall,
saying openly that they would &ldquo;fache&rdquo; out of prison
the said John Cradeley and Thomas Morres, and destroy your said
town of Walsall.</p>
<p>And thereupon William Harper and William Wilkes, Justices of
the Peace, charged the said riotous persons to keep the peace
upon a great pain to be forfeited to your grace.&nbsp; By reason
whereof the said rioters for that time ceased from further
riot.</p>
<p>And whereas the said Justices of the Peace, knowing the said
rioters intended to make more riot, and to execute their malice
in doing some mischief or hurt to the said town or to the
inhabitants thereof, for eschewing any riot or breach of the
peace commanded the inhabitants of Walsall, Wednesbury, and of
divers other towns, their adherents, that they should not
assemble together out of the said town, and should not come to a
Fair that should be holden at Wilnale on Trinity Sunday, then
next following.</p>
<p>And the inhabitants of Walsall the same day kept at home.</p>
<p><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

William Milner, calling himself the Abbot of Marram, and one
Walter Leveson with him, with the inhabitants of Hampton to the
number of four score persons in harness [armour] after the manner
of war, to Wilnall to the said Fair.&nbsp; And also one Robert
Marchall, of Wednesbury, calling himself Robyn Hood, and Sir
Richard Foxe, priest, with divers other persons to the number of
100 men and above, in harness, came in likewise, and met with the
said other rioters at the said town of Wilnall, and then and
there riotously assembled themselves, commanding openly that if
any of the town of Walsall came therefrom, to strike them down,
and in the said town continued their said riotous assembly all
the same day; and if any man of Walsall at that day had been seen
at that Fair, they should have been in jeopardy of their
lives.</p>
<p>Please your highness to grant your Letters of Privy Seal to be
directed to the said John Beamonde, Walter Leveson, Sir Richard
Foxe, priest, and Roger Marchall, to commanding them to appear
before your Council to answer to the premises.</p>

<p>Three several letters issued to Walter Leveson, Richard Foxe,

<p>The Bill is only &ldquo;feyned a yenst hym in pure

loss of his goods.&nbsp; He did not riotously assemble with any
persons in arms, nor is he guilty of any riot.&nbsp; As for the
coming to the said Fair at Wylnahale &ldquo;hit hath byn of olde
tymes used and accustumed in the said Fere day that with the

</blockquote>
<p>And this is all we know of that lively &ldquo;Whitsun
Morris&rdquo; at Willenhall Fair in the year of grace 1498.&nbsp;
It all reads like a delightful chapter in the vein of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Dogberry and Verges; and it will be noted
that the priests are among the captains or ringleaders in this
Sunday revelling.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>After the Reformation came the Puritans, who severely
discountenanced all Sunday revelry.&nbsp; And so the lampoon of
their enemies ran:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>There dwells a people on the earth<br
/>
That reckons true religion treason,<br />
That makes sad war on holy mirth,<br />
Count madness zeal and nonsense reason;<br />
That think no freedom but in slavery,<br />
That makes lyes truth, religion, knavery;<br />
That rob and cheat with &ldquo;yea&rdquo; and
&ldquo;nay,&rdquo;<br />
Riddle me, riddle me, who are they?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, when religious differencies had brought on civil war, it
had to be confessed of this Puritan people (so says Sir Francis
Doyle in &ldquo;The Cavalier&rdquo;):&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That though they snuffled psalms, to give<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rebel dogs their due,<br />
When the roaring shot poured thick and hot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They were stalwart men and true.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so the mighty struggle for liberty of conscience against
the pretensions of a dominant Church had proceeded for over
century, when we find the incumbency of Willenhall held by the
Rev. Thomas Badland.</p>
<p>Thomas Badland was born in 1643, matriculated at Pembroke
College, Oxford, 1650, and took his B.A. degree, 1653.&nbsp; He
was one of the noble band of ministers who relinquished their
livings on August 24th, 1662, rather than conform to the
requirements of the Act of Uniformity, passed on the Restoration
of Charles II.</p>
<p>On his ejectment from Willenhall, this conscientious Puritan
divine returned to his native city, Worcester, where &ldquo;he
formed a distinct congregation of Christians, who assembled for
worship in a small room&rdquo; at the bottom of Fish
Street.&nbsp; His family was an old one in Worcester, the name
Badland occurring in a charter of James I.</p>
<p>According to Noake&rsquo;s &ldquo;Worcester Sects,&rdquo; he
was minister of that congregation for 35 years; but before his
death the Declaration of Indulgence by James II. was made (1687),
and immediately thereupon Mr. Badland&rsquo;s church was
regularly constituted by the adoption of the Covenants of church
membership which had been drawn by Richard Baxter&mdash;he was a
personal friend of the eminent divine&mdash;in terms sufficiently
general to include almost all denominations who might choose to
make it a point of common agreement.</p>
<p><!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>From Nash&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of
Worcestershire&rdquo; we learn that on a monument on the south
wall of the south aisle of St. Martin&rsquo;s church, Worcester,
it was set forth:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Under these seats lies interred the body of the
Rev. Thomas Badland, a faithful and profitable preacher of the
Gospel in this city for the space of thirty-five years.&nbsp; He
rested from his labours, May 5th, <span class="smcap">a.d</span>
1698, &aelig;t. 64.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mors mihi vita nova.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When St. Martin&rsquo;s Church was pulled down in 1768 this
marble tablet was carelessly thrown aside, and soon got broken
into fragments.&nbsp; Happily the pieces were rescued and put
together again with loving care for erection in the vestibule of
Angel Street Chapel, at the expense of the congregation
worshipping there.&nbsp; In the new Independent Chapel, which has
taken the place of that older building (registered at Quarter
Sessions in 1689 as a Presbyterian place of worship), the
memorial has been placed near the pulpit.</p>
<p>From a MS. history of Angel Street Church, written by Samuel
Blackwell in 1841, it would appear that Mr. Badland had as one of
his assistants a Mr. Hand, who had been ordained at
Oldbury.&nbsp; At Fish Street Chapel (the site of which was
occupied in later times by Dent&rsquo;s Glove Factory), there
were 120 Communicants in February, 1687; and the Declaration of
Faith drawn up and signed by the church members that year bears
first the name of Thomas Badland, pastor, and among many others
that follow is that of &ldquo;Elizab. Badland,&rdquo; presumably
his wife.&nbsp; Such, briefly, is the life history of the good
man who relinquished the living of Willenhall, and repudiated its
&ldquo;idolatrous steeple-house,&rdquo; at the Black Bartholomew
of 1662, rather than stifle the dictates of his conscience.</p>
<p>In Palmer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nonconformist&rsquo; Memorials&rdquo;
the Rev. Thomas Badland has been confused with the Rev. Thomas
Baldwin, who was ejected (1662) from the Vicarage of Chaddesley
Corbett, and who died at Kidderminster in 1693, his funeral
sermon being preached by a conforming clergyman there, named
White.&nbsp; There was also a Thomas Baldwin, junior, who had
been expelled from <!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>the Vicarage of Clent, and died at
Birmingham; but notwithstanding such common mispronunciations as
&ldquo;Badlam&rdquo; for &ldquo;Badland,&rdquo; it seems clear
that the facts of the Rev. Mr. Badland&rsquo;s life are as given
here, thanks to the careful researches of Mr. A. A. Rollason, of
Dudley.</p>

(1640&ndash;1745).</h2>
<p>Life in Willenhall, as in many other places during the Stuart
period, was not without its alarms and apprehensions.&nbsp; The
trouble began when Charles I., by the advice of Archbishop Laud,
tried to force the English liturgy upon Scotland.&nbsp; The
resistance offered to this was the real beginning of the English
Revolution, for the King, in the attempt to carry out his
despotic will, had to enlist soldiers by force.</p>

<p>In the year 1640 a special muster was made for the war against
the Scotch Covenanters; the men from Staffordshire consisted of
trained bands who had been employed in the previous year, and 300
men who were impressed for the occasion.&nbsp; The service
throughout the country was very unpopular, and in some counties
the men mutinied and murdered their officers.&nbsp; Staffordshire
did not escape some riots, and one of the most serious of them
occurred in front of Bentley Hall, a mile and a-half out of
Willenhall.</p>

with the newly-invented firelock, while the whole of the
impressed men were armed merely with pikes.&nbsp; The Muster Roll

<p>Another Roll dated 1634, but apparently in use at this time,
gives among the names of the &ldquo;trayned horse&rdquo; liable
as (or for) <!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>2 &ldquo;curiasiers,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Thomas Levison, Esq.,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mrs. Lane and her
sonne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within a couple of years Civil War had broken out in England,
and Willenhall had to endure its full share of suffering lying,
as it did, midway between two opposing strongholds&mdash;Dudley
Castle, held for the King (under Colonel Leveson), and Rushall
Hall, garrisoned for the Parliamentarian side.</p>
<p>Both sides in turn, as they were in a position to enforce
payment, made levies of money upon the unfortunate inhabitants of
the district.&nbsp; While Rushall Hall was a fortified position,
first under its owner, Sir Edward Leigh, and afterwards under its
military governor, Captain Tuthill, Willenhall was forced to pay
to the support of the garrison there.</p>
<p>Here is the evidence of an official notice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>April 8th, 1643.&mdash;Ordered that the weekly
pay, and five weeks&rsquo; arrears, of Norton and Wirley,
Pelsall, Rushall, and Goscote, Willenhall, Wednesfield and
Wednesbury, shall be assigned to Col. Leigh for payment of his
officers of horse and troopers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a similar military order, dated 22nd June, 1644, by
which the weekly pay of all these places is assigned to Captain
Tuthill, governor of Rushall, though in the parcelling out of
contributory areas, Bushbury, Wolverhampton, Bilston, and Bradley
are included in another district.&nbsp; The other side were
employing forced labour for strengthening the defence of Dudley
Castle, and not improbably the Leveson tenants from Wednesfield
and Willenhall were impressed to go up there equipped with spade
and mattock.</p>
<p>Doubtless troops and detachments of armed men were frequently
to be seen passing through Willenhall; while Wolverhampton, owing
to the influence of the Levesons and the Goughs, was almost a
Royalist rallying place.&nbsp; Soon after the skirmish at Hopton
Heath, near Stafford, in 1643, Charles I. found shelter in the
old Star and Garter Inn (then in Cock Street), and to this
hostelry came Mr. Henry Gough, who had accommodated Charles,
Prince of Wales, and his younger brother, James, Duke of York,
<!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>at his private residence, to proffer the King a willing
war loan of &pound;1,200.</p>
<p>The same year the King made the same hostelry his
headquarters, dating a letter which he addressed to the Lichfield
magistrates, directing them to send their arms to join the Royal
standard at Nottingham, &ldquo;Att our Court at Wolverhampton, 17
August, 1642.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1643, Prince Rupert, after his memorable fight at
Birmingham, made an attack upon Rushall Hall; and notwithstanding
the gallant defence of Mistress Leigh, in the absence of her
husband, its lord, took and held it for the King, putting in as
governor Sir Edward Leigh&rsquo;s neighbour, Colonel Lane, of
Bentley.&nbsp; With a garrison of 100 to 200 men, he held Rushall
Hall for some months, having some exciting times, chiefly in the
plundering of the enemy&rsquo;s stores, and the private
merchandise of carriers passing along the great Watling Street
over Cannock Chase.</p>
<p>On May 10th, 1644, the Earl of Denbigh, after a vigorous
attack, recaptured Rushall, finding there thousands of
pounds&rsquo; worth of stolen goods, and taking among other
prisoners William Hopkins, of Oakeswell Hall, Wednesbury.&nbsp;
It was then Captain Tuthill became commander of the garrison.</p>
<p>In the same month the Stafford Parliamentarian Committee
ordered the seizure of all the horses and cattle belonging to
that staunch Royalist, Squire Lane, and of all the other cavalier
landowners around Bentley.&nbsp; The seizure was duly made, and
realised by sale at Birmingham.&nbsp; As a set-off to this it
must be recounted that at the beginning of the year Colonel Lane
had fallen upon a Parliamentary escort convoying stores and
provisions to Stafford, routed the enemy, and taken no less than
sixty horses, fifty-five of their packs containing
ammunition.&nbsp; Hence, the reprisal at this first
opportunity.</p>
<p>In the September of the year (1644) a remarkable episode
occurred.&nbsp; The governor of Dudley Castle, Sir Thomas
Leveson, employed one of his trusty tenants, a yeoman named
Francis Pitt, of Wednesfield, to make a secret attempt to bribe
Captain Tuthill <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>to betray Rushall and its garrison
into his hands.&nbsp; A number of letters passed between Leveson
and Tuthill, for the latter pretended from the outset to fall in
with the treacherous proposal, with the object of recovering some
prisoners; which having accomplished, he seized Pitt, the
go-between, and delivered him up to the Parliament.</p>
<p>Colonel Leveson, unconscious of this treachery, came according
to arrangement to Rushall, but instead of finding an easy
entrance, had two &ldquo;drakes,&rdquo; or small cannons, fired
upon him, killing a number of his troops.&nbsp; The letters of
Leveson and Tuthill will be found printed in full in
Willmore&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Walsall.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
unfortunate messenger, Francis Pitt, was tried in London by
&ldquo;Court Martial,&rdquo; and hanged at Smithfield on October
12th.&nbsp; It transpired at the trial that he was selected by
Colonel Leveson because he held a farm of him for life, was
familiar with Rushall Hall, and had told him he had to go there
to pay his war contributions, and sometimes to redeem his
neighbours&rsquo; cattle.&nbsp; On the one side Captain Tuthill
had promised him &pound;100 of the &pound;2,000 bribe by which it
was proposed to seduce him, and on the other his landlord had
offered to remit seven years of his rent.&nbsp; Such is the
fortune of war, however, the poor wretch, instead of reward, met
with an ignominious death at the age of 65, after a life of
honest toil.</p>
<p>In 1645 Prince Rupert had his headquarters in Wolverhampton,
while the King lay two miles to the north of the town, where
tradition says he watched a skirmish with the enemy from Bushbury
Hill.&nbsp; When Charles I. fled before Cromwell at Naseby on
June 14th of that year he passed through Lichfield and entered
Wolverhampton.&nbsp; After sleeping the night, either at the Old
Hall, Robert Levenson&rsquo;s residence, or at a house in Old
Lichfield Street, the unfortunately King passed on the next
morning towards Bewdley.</p>
<p>Some interesting local information during this war time is to
be derived from the literary remains of an officer in the
King&rsquo;s Army, one Captain Symmonds, who amused himself on
his marches by taking heraldic notes, and noticing monumental
inscriptions.&nbsp; An entry in his Diary thus alludes to the
foregoing facts:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>Friday, May
16, 1645.</p>
<p>The rendezvous was near the King&rsquo;s quarters.&nbsp; Began
after 4 o&rsquo;clock in the morning here.&nbsp; One soldier was
hanged for mutiny.</p>
<p>The prince&rsquo;s headquarters was at Wolverhampton.&nbsp; A
handsome towne.&nbsp; One faire church in it.</p>
<p>The King lay at Bisbury.&nbsp; A private sweet village where
Squire Grosvenor (as they call him) lives.&nbsp; Which name hath
continued here 120 years.&nbsp; Before him lived Bisbury of
Bisbury.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our military diarist next writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Satterday, May 17, 1645.&mdash;His Majestie
marched from here to Tong&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and goes on to enumerate the garrisons in Staffordshire at
that date, distinguishing by initials which were
&ldquo;Rebel&rdquo; and which were the
&ldquo;King&rsquo;s&rdquo;; among them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>K.&nbsp; Lichfield.&mdash;Colonel Bagott,
governor.</p>
<p>R.&nbsp; Russell hall.&mdash;A taylor governor.</p>
<p>R.&nbsp; Mr. Gifford&rsquo;s house at Chillington, three miles
from Wolverhampton.&nbsp; Now slighted by themselves.</p>
<p>K.&nbsp; Dudley Castle.&mdash;Colonel Leveson, whose estate
and habitation is at Wolverhampton, is governor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Slighted&rdquo; signifies dismantled of its
fortification; the allusion to &ldquo;a tailor&rdquo; being
military governor of Rushall is, of course, a cavalier&rsquo;s
sneer at the Republican soldiery.</p>
<p>Coming now to the end of the war, when Charles II. was
defeated at Worcester in 1651, the country round Willenhall
became the scene of that fugitive monarch&rsquo;s most romantic
wanderings.&nbsp; Flying from the battlefield at the close of
that fatal September day, Charles made his way through
Stourbridge to Whiteladies and Boscobel.&nbsp; Then occurred the
episode of his hiding in the &ldquo;Royal Oak,&rdquo; and his
concealment inside the house, in the &ldquo;priests&rsquo;
hole&rdquo; at the top of the stairs, by Mrs. Penderel.</p>
<p>Fearing discovery, the King was escorted by the brothers
Penderel to Moseley Hall, near Bushbury, a timber-framed <!--
page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>mansion in the picturesque Elizabethan style, the home
of the Whitgreates, where the hunted monarch was welcomed and
immediately refreshed with some biscuits and a bottle of
sack.&nbsp; Charles had scarcely departed from Boscobel ere a
troop of Roundheads arrived to search it.&nbsp; And another
narrow escape now occurred at Moseley, where again a cunningly
contrived hiding place was brought into requisition.&nbsp; Even
after the frustration of the search party, one Southall, a
notorious &ldquo;priest catcher,&rdquo; called at the suspected
house.</p>
<p>Prudence dictated another secret flight, and taking advantage
of a dark night the unhappy King was taken by Colonel Lane to his
own house, and was next hidden at Bentley Hall.</p>
<p>The story of the escape of Charles II. from Bentley towards
the continent, disguised as a groom and riding in front of Jane
Lane&rsquo;s pillion, is too well known to need re-telling
here.&nbsp; The episode is historic; it is the subject of a
fresco painted on the walls of a corridor in the gilded chambers
of Parliament.</p>
<p>The whole romance of Boscobel and Bentley is told with
considerable fulness in Shaw&rsquo;s &ldquo;Staffordshire&rdquo;
(I., pp. 73&ndash;84), and is accompanied by very interesting
engravings of Boscobel, Moseley Hall, and Old Bentley.</p>
<p>As a result of the Revolution of 1688, and with the death of
Queen Anne in 1714, the impracticable Stuarts disappeared for
good from the English throne; but as adherents to their
discredited cause, known as Jacobites, still remained numerous,
it may be guessed they were not lacking in and around
Willenhall.</p>
<p>After the Hanoverian Succession there were, in fact, a number
of avowed Jacobites in this vicinity, who refused to take the
oath of allegiance to George I.&nbsp; Their names and behaviour
were kept strictly under notice by the Government, but for fear
of driving them to extremes no active measures were taken against
them or their estates.&nbsp; A list of these non-jurors and Roman
Catholics was compiled after the rebellion of 1715, and again in
1745, when the rebellion of the Young Pretender once more
disturbed the Kingdom.&nbsp; A list of these suspects was
published on each occasion by the Government, with the amount of
penalties <!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span

72</span>XIV.&mdash;Litigation Concerning the Willenhall Prebend
(1615&ndash;1702).</h2>
<p>The Prebend had little to do with Willenhall, except in
name.&nbsp; However, as the name of Willenhall was attached to
this particular &ldquo;canonical portion&rdquo; in the Collegiate
Church of Wolverhampton, and more especially as the Levesons are
connected with its later history, reference to it cannot well be
omitted.</p>
<p>The Leveson family had been dealing with Wolverhampton church
property for centuries, and in the Stuart period were lessees of
the greater part of it at a nominal rent of &pound;38 per
annum.&nbsp; Their standing in the county may be gauged by this
entry which the Heralds made concerning the family at
&ldquo;Visitation&rdquo; 1538:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Leveson of Willenhall was living in 27
Edward I.&nbsp; He married Margereye, daughter of Henry Fitz
Clemente of Wolverhampton.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By an indenture of the year 1613 the Dean and Chapter of
Wolverhampton leased the deanery, prebends, and manor of
Wolverhampton to Sir Walter Leveson, and all the lands belonging
thereto in various parts of Staffordshire and Worcestershire,
including those at Willenhall, Wednesfield, Bentley, &amp;c.,
with all the mines of sea coal, ironstone, &amp;c., on the said
premises, but specially excepting the patronage and gifts of
prebends, canonship, and all their offices and ecclesiastical
jurisdiction; all at an annual reserved rent of &pound;38, and
the quaint old-world tenure of having &ldquo;to entertain the
Dean and his retinue two days and three nights in each
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The validity of these leases was questioned a few years later
in the 13th year of James I., the lessee having refused to pay
the reserved rents without considerable deductions; and a bill
was filed in Chancery by Joseph Hall, D.D., prebendary of
Willenhall, and Christopher Cragg, prebendary of Hatherton
(probably on the advice of the newly installed Dean, Dr. Anthony
Maxey), against the aforesaid, Sir Walter Leveson, who was then
in possession of <!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the property belonging to their two
prebends, as well as other possessions belonging to the College
of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>Although the case was decided against Sir Walter Leveson, the
prebendaries reaped little or no benefit; for Sir Walter died
immediately after, leaving his heir a minor, and a ward of the
King.&nbsp; During the wardship the King attempted to settle the
questions and controversies which had arisen when he made the
appointment of a new Dean.</p>
<p>It must be borne in mind that the Deans of Wolverhampton were
also Deans of Windsor; and Dr. Maxey dying about 1618, there
followed a somewhat quick succession of Deans.&nbsp; These were
Matthew Wren (1628), protege of Laud, and successively Bishop of
Hereford, of Norwich, and of Ely; Christopher Wren, his brother
(1634), father of the famous architect of the same name; Dr.
Bruno Ryes (1660); and Dr. Brideoak, who became Bishop of
Chichester in 1675.</p>
<p>The wardship of young Leveson lasted 16 years, and when he
came of age the prebendaries were glad to come to a composition
with him.</p>
<p>By this composition he agreed to pay them &pound;30 per annum
each, in full satisfaction of the several tithes and other
profits belonging in right to their respective prebends; this
being over and above the said reserved rents which had been
previously paid.&nbsp; Arrangements were made at the same time
with the rest of the prebendaries respecting the several
proportions of the tithe belonging to them.</p>
<p>About this time the Dean and Prebendaries successfully
resisted an attempt of the Archbishop of Canterbury to hold a
visitation within the &ldquo;peculiar&rdquo;&mdash;the
church&rsquo;s jurisdiction within itself.</p>
<p>After the Civil War the Prebendaries found that they had
suffered considerable losses by the acts of their predecessors;
so it was determined by Thomas Wren, LL.D. (son of the
aforementioned Rev. Matthew Wren, Bishop of Ely, whose literary
remains include &ldquo;A Brief History of the Parish and
Jurisdiction of Wolverhampton, from the Time of King
Edgar&rdquo;) prebendary of <!-- page 74--><a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Willenhall,
and C&aelig;sar Callendine, B.D., prebendary of Hatherton, to
file a bill in Chancery against Robert Leveson for a discovery of
the lands he held which anciently belonged to the prebendaries of
Wolverhampton, and that he might show by what title he held
them.</p>
<p>The hearing was before the great Lord Chancellor of that day,
Lord Clarendon, who dismissed the bill, though without costs.</p>
<p>The Leveson family consequently continued in the undisturbed
enjoyment of the church property, granted to them in fee farm by
six prebendaries, as well as of divers other freehold estates in
the parish of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>The Leveson property in Wolverhampton became much implicated
in the numerous family settlements till, in 1702, Frances, Earl
of Bradford, purchased it of Robert Leveson for
&pound;22,000.&nbsp; Lord Bradford also acquired, three years
later, the estate of the Dean and Prebends of Wolverhampton which
had been leased to the Earl of Windsor; so that the entire
property of the Collegiate Church (except the prebendal houses
and some property which had been set aside for the use of the
Sacrist), passed into the hands of one and the same
proprietor.</p>
<p>In the same year, however, the Dean, Prebendaries, and Sacrist
filed a bill in Chancery against Leveson and the Earl for the
recovery of the property.&nbsp; The plaintiffs were Gregory
Hascard, D.D., dean; Prebendaries John Hinton (Willenhall),
Richard Redding (Kinvaston), Thomas Allestree (Hilton), John
Plimley (Fetherstone), John Hilman (Hatherton), Richard Ames
(Monmore), Walter Ashley (Wobaston), and Henry Wood, sacrist.</p>
<p>They contended they were all clerks, constituted one entire
body, and rector or parson incorporate, of the whole parish of
Wolverhampton, which was of very great extent, consisting of 16
or 17 hamlets or villages besides the large town of
Wolverhampton, being in circuit about thirty miles, in three of
which said hamlets there were chapels of ease, the several cures
thereof belonging to the said College or Free Chapel Royal.</p>
<p><!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>In all this litigation it was a question much agitated
whether, as all the prebendaries with the Dean and the Sacrist
constituted one entire body, any single prebendary could demise
his annual portion of the said general tithes without the consent
of the whole body.</p>
<p>The defendant Leveson was accused of having contrived secret
conveyances of many parcels of the said tithes and lands for the
benefit of his own family, some of the properties having been
sold for large sums of money, and the church revenues defrauded
thereby.&nbsp; Also that he had so altered and confounded the
buildings, fences, and boundaries of the church lands, and so
mixed them up with his own inherited lands, that it had become
impossible to discern or distinguish which were the original
possessions of the College; possessions which at the Domesday
Survey had extended to 3,000 acres, besides the lordship of
Lutley, near Halesowen.</p>
<p>Dr. Oliver states that in his time (1836) there remained some
&ldquo;houses and lands now belonging to the prebendaries and
Sacrist, which are leased out for lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;corpses&rdquo; of the six prebends are supposed to
have consisted of the tithes of their respective districts in
Willenhall, Hilton, Hatherton, Fetherston, Monmore, and
Wobaston.</p>
<p>The Rev. Richard Ames, Curate of Bilston for 46 years
(1684&ndash;1730), makes the following record:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1723, December 9th.&mdash;The Reverd. Mr. Wm.
Craddock, Rector of Donnington (Salop), was installed Prebendary
of Willenhall, he having resigned that of Hatherston.&nbsp; The
mandate for his installmt. was directed to me (ye Senior
Prebendary) by ye Rt. Hon&rsquo;ble George, Lord Willoughby de
Broke, Deane of o&rsquo;r Collegiate Church of Wolverhampton, and
of Windsor; I being constituted locum tenens.</p>
<p>On ye 10th December, 1723, by virtue of an&rsquo;r mandate to
me, directed by ye same Ld. Willoughby de Broke, ye same Mr. Wm.
Craddock was by me put in possession of ye Sacrist&rsquo;s Stall,
both which places became vacant by ye death of Mr. Hinton.&nbsp;
He (Mr. Craddock) was also constituted principal official.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>In 1836, when Dr. Oliver wrote his history of the
church, the Chapter of the College consisted of the Hon. Henry
Lewis Hobart, D.D. (Dean), the Rev. R. Ellison, M.A., prebendary
of Willenhall, and the other prebendaries (of Kinvaston, Hilton,
Featherston, Monmore, Hatherton, and Wobaston respectively), and
the Rev. G. Oliver, D.D., perpetual curate and Sacrist (an Act
obtained in 1811 by Dean Legge had constituted the Sacrist the
real incumbent of the church).&nbsp; The Chapter had it own seal,
which was of proper ecclesiastical design, and of some
antiquity.</p>
<p>On the death of the very Rev. and Hon. H. L. Hobart, D.C.L.,
&amp;c., in 1846, the Collegiate establishment of Wolverhampton
ceased to exist, and its property became vested in the
ecclesiastical Commissioners.</p>
<p>Such was the gross abuse of ecclesiastical patronage, the
entire income of the Collegiate Church (except &pound;100 a year
for a curate of very indefinite status) had been absorbed in the
payment of a Dean of the two &ldquo;peculiars&rdquo; of Windsor
and Wolverhampton, and of some half-dozen legendary prebendaries
who were for the most part unknown, even by name, to the oldest
inhabitant of the parish.</p>
<p>With the suppression of the ancient Deanery, the modern
township of Wolverhampton was divided into thirteen
ecclesiastical parishes.</p>

77</span>XV.&mdash;Willenhall Struggling to be a Free
Parish.</h2>
<p>In the eighteenth century the ecclesiastical history of
Willenhall reached a critical stage.&nbsp; Long and bitter were
the disputes which arose between the mother church of
Wolverhampton and the daughter chapelries of Willenhall and
Bilston; and perhaps the temper of the authorities at the former
had not been improved by the gradual impoverishment of the
residentiaries there, the history of which formed the subject of
the last chapter.</p>
<p>The first cause of the quarrel was found in the fact that
these two places, having become as populous as towns of ordinary
status, were without legal burying-grounds.&nbsp; When land had
been provided there seems to have been considerable hesitancy on
the part of the authorities in allowing Willenhall and Bilston
these ordinary parochial privileges.&nbsp; The Rev. Richard Ames,
of Bilston, has left it on record that on June 9th, 1726, he
waited upon the Bishop of the diocese, while he was holding a
confirmation at Walsall, when &ldquo;John Lane, Esqre., of
Bentley, mov&rsquo;d his lordship to consecrate Willenhall and
Bilston Chapelyards for burial-places, wch. his lordship seemed
inclinable to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The history of the conflict goes back to 1709, when Dr.
Manningham, on becoming Dean, convened a Chapter at Oxford which
was attended by all the Prebendaries and the Sacrist.&nbsp; This
meeting was specially called to consider the case of the
inhabitants of Willenhall and Bilston, who had represented to the
Dean the great inconveniences which arose in having to carry
their dead from these chapelries for interment at Wolverhampton;
and humbly praying that their respective chapels and chapelyards
should be consecrated for the proper burial of the dead.</p>
<p>The prayer was granted, but it was most carefully stipulated
that the inhabitants of the two chapelries should always pay the
customary levies to the mother church, and also the fees for
burials and for the churching of women, to the respective curates
of the said chapels, as well as to the ministers of the mother
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>church; and that the expenses attending the desired
consecrations should be paid by the petitioners.</p>
<p>A subsequent Chapter, held 10 October, 1718, confirmed this,
when the Ministers and Inhabitants of the Chapelries of Bilston
and Willenhall signed an Agreement to observe and perform the
said conditions.&nbsp; For the carrying out of the agreement in
business-like form the said Ministers covenanted to pay the said
fees half-yearly, at Lady-day and Michaelmas, transmitting a copy
of their respective Registers &ldquo;without reserve or
fraud&rdquo; to be transcribed into the books of the mother
church.</p>
<p>The fees to be charged each Chapelry were fixed to a scale:
tenpence for &ldquo;ye churching of every woman&rdquo;;
sevenpence for the burial of each body in the churchyard, and
twice that amount for the burial inside the church: and so
on.</p>
<p>Subsequently (some 30 years after, when St. John&rsquo;s
Chapel, Wolverhampton, was in contemplation) the inhabitants of
the Liberties of Willenhall and Bilston, notwithstanding the
written agreement aforesaid, peremptorily and finally refused to
pay their respective fees for Christenings, Churchings, and
Burials to the Sacrist and Curates of Wolverhampton; payments
whereby the profits of their several offices were lessened more
than half, and the loss was so considerable it was no longer to
be borne.</p>
<p>At Bilston the quarrel of 1753 was practically not settled for
nearly a century afterwards.&nbsp; It was ruled that whatever
might be arranged in respect of fees for other rites no marriages
could be legally performed in the Chapel except by licence of
Wolverhampton, which claimed a &ldquo;Peculiar&rdquo;
jurisdiction; and as the inhabitants indignantly refused to pay
double marriage fees, no marriage was solemnised in the chapel
from January, 1754, to February, 1841.</p>
<p>The same year&mdash;to be exact, the date was April 12th,
1841&mdash;the first marriage was solemnised at Willenhall
Church, the Bishop having then issued a special licence to the
Incumbent to marry persons living within the township.</p>
<p><!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>Almost concurrently with this dispute there was another
source of grievance to Willenhall, Bilston, and Pelsall which had
to be strenuously fought by these outlying places.</p>
<p>This quarrel arose, in the main, through the excessive demands
made upon the inhabitants of the three chapelries for rates with
which to repair and maintain the fabric of Wolverhampton
Church.&nbsp; The levies made ostensibly for this purpose seem to
have been at times somewhat exorbitant, and the money to have
been spent in meeting charges which can only be described as
superfluous so far as the non-residential contributors were
concerned.</p>
<p>About 1738 the chapelwardens of Bilston made a determined
stand against the churchwardens of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;case was stated&rdquo; in which it was shown that the
Collegiate Church of Wolverhampton consisted of a Dean and
Prebendaries, founded by a Royal Family, and was subject to no
visitation but that of the Crown.&nbsp; It contained three
Chapels&mdash;one at Bilston, another at Willenhall, and a third
at Pelsall.</p>
<p>The statement proceeded:&mdash;&ldquo;Every Hamlet and Village
in the Ecclesiastical Parish of Wolverhampton has a Constable and
all other parochial officers, and maintains its own poor as it
were a separate parish. . . .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chapelries of Willenhall and Bilston nominate and
maintain each its own Clergy, and repair their own Chapels, which
have been endowed time out of mind, and were consecrated about
thirteen years ago for burying places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other points of complaint put forward were that the two
chapels afforded every facility to the inhabitants of the
respective places for divine worship and the administration of
the sacraments; that formerly Bilston and Willenhall each paid
only &pound;4 a year to the mother church, but that since 1716
increasing demands had been made till as much as &pound;56 was
asked for; and that all which these chapelries received in return
were the bread and wine used in the sacrament, four times a year,
and for which they paid &pound;4 per annum, the chapelwardens
being allowed 3d. in the &pound; at Boston and 4d. in the &pound;
at Willenhall for collecting it.</p>
<p><!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>It was also complained that all the rest of the villages
had been forced &ldquo;to contribute in like proportion with
these two towns,&rdquo; and that these levies on the out-hamlets
had been made for additions to, or improvements of, Wolverhampton
Church, which were quite superfluous in their character, if not
absolutely illegal.</p>
<p>On this opinion (of a learned Sergeant-at-Law) the inhabitants
of Willenhall were invited to join with those of Bilston in a
common defence for their mutual benefit.&nbsp; On the advice of
the esteemed Dr. Wilkes, a well-known local Antiquary, who was
then the leading public man of Willenhall, the invitation was
declined.</p>
<p>Litigation proceeded for several years both in the
ecclesiastical courts and in chancery, but without any definite
decision being arrived at.</p>
<p>In 1754 the Earl of Stamford tried to induce both parties to
submit a case fairly drawn up (for the legal work in the
preparation of which he generously offered to pay all the costs)
and to abide by the decision.&nbsp; The people of Willenhall,
through Dr. Wilkes, thanked his lordship for his friendly offer,
and declared their willingness to accept it.</p>
<p>The Wolverhampton officials, however, rejected the proposal,
in the hope they would win their case in the ecclesiastical
courts.&nbsp; When the case eventually came to trial in 1755 an
old parish book was produced, which showed that the exorbitant
demands of Wolverhampton were distinctly illegal.&nbsp; In it was
an entry of 1668, which ran in this wise:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This is the portion of Rates each Chapelry
and Prebend shall pay towards the repairs of the Mother
Church:&mdash;</p>

82</span>XVI.&mdash;Dr. Richard Wilkes, of Willenhall
(1690&ndash;1760).</h2>
<p>Willenhall&rsquo;s most illustrous son was Dr. Richard Wilkes,
Antiquary, whose house still stands on the Walsall Road.&nbsp; He
came of good family of county rank, and his personal character
raised him to the eminence of a notability in
Staffordshire.&nbsp; His portrait appears in Shaw&rsquo;s history
of this county of which his (Wilkes&rsquo;) valuable and
voluminous MSS. formed the nucleus.&nbsp; Though settled in this
locality, adding to their little patrimony from time to time for
300 or 400 years, the family came originally from
Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>The pedigree of Wilkes, according to the Heralds&rsquo;
Visitation in 1614, commences with John Wylkys de Darlaston, who
was witness to a Deed of Roger, Lord of Darlaston, in the time of
Edward III. (1331).&nbsp; There is a Richard Wylkys, of
Willenhall, who witnessed a Bentley Deed in 1413.&nbsp; To this
Richard and his wife Juliana, daughter and heir of William
Wilkes, a grant of lands in Bentley was made by Humphrey, Earl of
Stafford.&nbsp; The son of this couple was William Wilkes of
Willnall (1505).&nbsp; Protonotary of the Court of Common Pleas,
15 Henry VIII.&nbsp; The family tree is very complete in
Shaw.</p>
<p>One John Wilkes married a widow Parkhouse, <i>nee</i> Margery
Garbet, of Nether Penn; another John, his nephew, was Rector of
Lum, and evidently a Puritan, as his two sons bear the striking
biblical names, Ephraim and Manasses.&nbsp; Richard seems to have
been the favourite name for the eldest son.&nbsp; One Richard
married Mercy Drakeford, of Stafford (see Salt. Vol. VIII.); his
son, also named Richard, became the father of our Willenhall
worthy, whose mother was Lucretia, youngest daughter of Jonas
Astley, of Wood Eaton, in this county.</p>
<p>Richard Wilkes, M.D., was born in March, 1690, and had his
school education at Trentham.&nbsp; In his 19th year he was
entered at St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and was admitted
scholar 1710.&nbsp; In April, 1711, he began to attend Mr.
Saunderson&rsquo;s mathematical lectures, and became very
proficient in algebra.&nbsp; In January, <!-- page 83--><a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>1713, he took
his B.A degree; three years later he was chosen Fellow, and in
1718 he was appointed Linacre Lecturer.</p>
<p>It does not appear when or where he took his degrees in
medicine.&nbsp; He seems to have taken pupils and taught
mathematics in college from the year 1715 till he left it, and to
have been engaged thus early in literary matters, particularly in
the collection of material for subsequent use.&nbsp; It was by
his literary labours, particularly in antiquarian research, that
he made himself a name.</p>
<p>He presently took deacon&rsquo;s orders, and once preached in
the parish church of Wolverhampton.&nbsp; He also preached
several times at Stow, near Chartley.&nbsp; However,
disappointment in the expectation of preferment in the Church
soon disgusted him with the ministry, and in 1720 he began to
practise physic, for which he seemed to have a natural talent, at
Wolverhampton.&nbsp; In 1725 he married Rachel Manlove, of Abbots
Bromley, with whom he had a handsome fortune, and from that time
he dwelt with his father (who died in 1730) at Willenhall.</p>
<p>About this time he wrote an excellent treatise on Dropsy; and
later, when a dreadful disease raged among the horned cattle of
the Midlands, he published a very useful and practical
&ldquo;Letter to Breeders and Graziers in the County of
Stafford,&rdquo; and made every effort to assist in stamping out
the plague.&nbsp; Possibly while at Chartley he had made a study
of the herd of wild cattle preserved there.</p>
<p>His skill as a physician was very considerable, and seems to
have been applied chiefly to the gratuitous relief of his poorer
neighbours.&nbsp; He led an exemplary life, being an early riser,
and an indefatigable reader, constantly adding to the rich stores
of his well-stocked mind.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, he spent several years of industry in
collecting historical manuscripts, and making antiquarian notes
relating to his native county, of which the Rev. Stebbing Shaw
afterwards made such good use.</p>
<p>For instance, Dr. Wilkes&rsquo; account of Roman roads, camps,
and other remains of antiquity is a fairly exhaustive one for a
county history, and shows a considerable depth of research.&nbsp;
It is <!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>embodied in the
&ldquo;Introduction&rdquo; and the &ldquo;General History&rdquo;
at the commencement of Shaw&rsquo;s compendious work.</p>
<p>Like Pepys, he kept a Diary, which was never intended for
publication&mdash;he was a diligent recorder of historical
facts.&nbsp; Here is an interesting note from it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The first steam engine that ever raised any
quantity of water was erected near Wolverhampton, on the
right-hand side of the road leading to Walsall, over against the
half-mile stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; (This was on the site of the
Chillington ironworks.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Diarist was too modest to add that the Waterworks which
long supplied Wolverhampton with water were the property of Dr.
Wilkes.</p>
<p>Among other projected literary works was a new edition of
Hudibras, with notes, &amp;c.&nbsp; In the beginning of the year
1747, having a severe fit of illness which confined him to the
house, he amused himself with writing his own epitaph, which he
calls &ldquo;A picture drawn from the life without
heightening.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Here, reader, stand awhile, and know<br />
Whose carcase &rsquo;tis that rots below;<br />
A man&rsquo;s, who walk&rsquo;d by Reason&rsquo;s rule<br />
Yet sometimes err&rsquo;d and play&rsquo;d the fool;<br />
A man&rsquo;s sincere in all his ways,<br />
And full of the Creator&rsquo;s praise,<br />
Who laughed at priestcraft, pride and strife,<br />
And all the little tricks of life.<br />
He lov&rsquo;d his king, his country more,<br />
And dreadful party-rage forbore:<br />
He told nobility the truth<br />
And winked at hasty slips of youth.<br />
The honest poor man&rsquo;s steady friend.<br />
The villain&rsquo;s sconce in hopes to mend.<br />
His father, mother, children, wife,<br />
His riches, honour, length of life,<br />
Concern not thee.&nbsp; Observe what&rsquo;s here&mdash;<br />
He rests in hope and not in fear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His wife dying in May, 1756, he married for the second time in
October the same year Mrs. Frances Bendish (sister to the Rev.
Sir Richard Wrottesley, of Wrottesley, Bart.), who long survived
him, dying December 24, 1798, at Froxfield, near Petersfield, in
Hampshire, at a very advanced age.</p>
<p>The learned doctor himself died March 6, 1760, with a return
of the gout in his stomach, and his death was universally
lamented <!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>by his tenants, who lost an indulgent
landlord; by his servants, who lost a good master; but more by
numbers of poor in the populous villages adjacent and at a
distance, in grateful remembrance of the charitable advice and
friendly assistance they had always enjoyed at his kindly
hands.&nbsp; A somewhat eulogistic entry of his death appears in
the Bilston Registers.</p>
<p>As Dr. Wilkes left no issue, his property passed to the Unett
family, the representatives of his aunt Anne who had married
George Unett, of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>He was buried at Willenhall in his native soil, where a neat
monument was erected to his memory near the family pew, by his
heirs, Captain Richard Wilkes Unett, and Mr. John Wilkes Unett;
the tablet was thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Near this

300 years and upwards.&nbsp; He married first, Rachel, eldest
daughter of Rowland Manlove, of Lees Hill, in this county, esq.;
secondly, Frances, daughter of Sir John, and sister</p>
<p style="text-align: center">of the late<br />

<p>&ldquo;The children of the late Rev. Thomas Unett, of

</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 86--><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>On the floor of the Lane Chapel in Wolverhampton Church
will be found stones to the memory of the Wilkes family,
&ldquo;seated at Willenhall from the reign of Edward IV.&rdquo;;
there is also a blue slab to the memory of Mary Unett, who died
in 1767.</p>
<p>The old house of Dr. Wilkes, a good specimen of its type of
architecture, stands back from the main road behind iron
palisading.&nbsp; Part of it has been utilised as a
stamper&rsquo;s warehouse; had it received the respect due to its
associations, it might flittingly have been a town Museum, or
some such public institution.&nbsp; It was built by the
Doctor&rsquo;s father, and the Doctor was born there.</p>
<p>The house has a white stuccoed front, irregularly disposed,
the semi-porticoed doorway with classic columns having three
windows on its left and two on its right, although the shorter
side seems to have been lengthened at a later period by a red
brick wing.&nbsp; Along the line of the first floor are six
windows, whose lights in the Annean period, to which the building
belongs, were doubtless of small leaded panes.</p>
<p>From the tiled roof project three dormers, the centre one
having a semi-circular head, the outer ones pointed.&nbsp; The
chimneys stand out from each gable end, and in the brickwork of
each of their sides is a plain recessed panel; the chimney-heads
being noticeable for the absence of the usual projecting
courses.&nbsp; Local tradition says that Hall street was once a
stately avenue of trees by which this residence was approached
from Lichfield Street.</p>
<p>On entering the house, the visitor feels a pang of regret that
the venerable building should ever have been degraded to the
purposes of commerce; particularly as the fabric retains many of
its characteristics, thanks to the soundness of the workmanship
of two centuries ago.&nbsp; The decorations in the form of
plaster mouldings that cover the beams, and the medallion or
panel pictures, being partly historical and partly classical, all
exhibit the Renaissance feeling of the early eighteenth
century.</p>
<p>The ceilings of two lower rooms are in a splendid state of
preservation, and contain excellent work.&nbsp; One room is
square with beams across the middle; the ceiling on one side of
the beam representing &ldquo;The Seasons,&rdquo; and on the other
side &ldquo;The <!-- page 87--><a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Elements.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Seasons
are severally depicted as follows:&mdash;A young face, with the
hair of the head bedecked with flowers, for &ldquo;Spring&rdquo;;
a face in the bloom of womanhood, with the hair bedecked with
corn, represents &ldquo;Summer&rdquo;; a well-matured face,
having the hair bedecked with fruit, &ldquo;Autumn&rsquo;&rdquo;;
while a pleasing aged face, the brow bedecked with holly, stands
for &ldquo;Winter.&rdquo;&nbsp; Painted on the wall over the
fireplace is the Castle of St. Angelo, and the bridge crossing
the Tiber at Rome.&nbsp; The Elements, (so called by the old
alchemists) are also figuratively, represented by four heads; one
bearing a castle, with three towers and other buildings in the
background (Earth); one surmounted by an eagle with outspread
wings (Air); the next with tongues of fire issuant (Fire); and
the other spouting forth a fountain (Water).</p>
<p>The other room is oblong, with beams across dividing its
ceiling into four parts.&nbsp; In these parts there are four
well-drawn figures, one believed to be Bacon, with beard,
moustache, whiskers, and in Elizabethan costume; two close
cropped heads, carried on noble necks, believed to be
respectively Julius C&aelig;sar and Mark Antony; and the fourth
is said to be Homer, with the customary curly hair and beard, but
showing a collar of some sort, and apparently wearing a skull
cap.&nbsp; Over the mantel, painted on canvas, is the Coliseum,
showing the Arch of Titus and a pool in the foreground.</p>
<p>In the main room upstairs is still to be seen the portrait of
Dr. Wilkes, painted on canvas, over the mantelpiece.&nbsp; He is
depicted as a clean shaven man with benevolent face, bluish or
blue-grey eyes, a good forehead, nose, mouth and chin
well-defined, and wearing a wig.&nbsp; His costume includes a
high-cut waistcoat, bearing ten buttons, opened in front nearly
all the way down to show cravat and frilled shirt, the cravat
having a buckle&mdash;probably jewelled in front.&nbsp; The outer
coat is without a collar, cut a little lower than the waistcoat,
sloping from above outwards, showing eight buttons, and
apparently of greenish-brown velvet.</p>
<p>The pool which formerly ornamented the garden had disappeared;
but the boathouse is still there, and the room above it in which
the Doctor used to keep his Antiquarian Collection and <!-- page
88--><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>other
artistic treasures.&nbsp; As to the lawns, shrubberies, gardens,
orchards, and pleasaunces, there is scarcely a remnant left.</p>
<p>Of the once sweet and pellucid stream, spanned by an
ornamental bridge, which conducted the rambler to the pleasant
meads beyond, nothing remains but the name, &ldquo;Willenhall
Brook&rdquo;&mdash;it is now little better than a dirty open
sewer.</p>
<p>It may not be generally known that a passing allusion is made
to Wilkes in Boswell&rsquo;s &ldquo;Life of Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the IV. chapter of Vol.&nbsp; I. of this monumental
biography we read that in 1740 Dr. Johnson wrote &ldquo;an
epitaph on Phillips, a musician, which was afterwards published
with some other pieces of his, in &lsquo;Mrs. Williams&rsquo;s
Miscellanies.&rsquo;&nbsp; This epitaph is so exquisitely
beautiful, that I remember even Lord Kaines, strangely prejudiced
as he was against Dr. Johnson, was compelled to allow it very
high praise.&nbsp; It has been ascribed to Mr. Garrick from its
appearing at first with the signature G; but I have heard Mr.
Garrick declare it was written by Dr. Johnson, and give the
following account of the manner in which it was composed.&nbsp;
Johnson and he were sitting together, when amongst other things
Garrick repeated an epitaph upon this Phillips, by a Dr. Wilkes,
in these words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Exalted soul! whose harmony could please<br />
The love-sick virgin, and the gouty ease;<br />
Could jarring discord, like Amphion, move<br />
To beauteous order and harmonious love;<br />
Rest here in peace, till angels bid thee rise<br />
And meet thy blessed Saviour in the skies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Johnson shook his head at the common-place funeral
lines, and said to Garrick, &lsquo;I think, Davy, I can make
better.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The great biographer goes on to state that Johnson, after
stirring about his tea and meditating a little while, produced
these lines:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Exalted soul! thy various sounds could please<br
/>
The love-sick virgin, and the gouty ease;<br />
Could jarring crowds, like old Amphion, move<br />
To beauteous order and harmonious love.<br />
Rest here in peace, till angels bid thee rise,<br />
And join thy Saviour&rsquo;s concert in the skies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Suffice it to add that the personage who inspired the lines
was an eccentric genius named Claudius Phillips <a
name="citation88"></a><a href="#footnote88"
class="citation">[88]</a>, on whose <!-- page 89--><a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>memorial
tablet in the porch of Wolverhampton Church were engraved the
said lines, attributed to Dr. Wilkes, who strangely enough is
described as &ldquo;of Trinity College, Oxford and Rector of
Pitchford, Salop&rdquo;&mdash;a clergyman whose name was John,
and who lived a century previously.&nbsp; We are further informed
that our Willenhall worthy is spoken of by Browne Willis in the
&ldquo;History of Mitred Abbies,&rdquo; Vol. II. p.
189&mdash;Browne Willis being one of the most notable
antiquarians of that period, and an eccentric individual
withal.</p>
<p>All this points to the fact that Dr. Richard Wilkes was well
known as a writer, and acknowledged as an authority.</p>

90</span>XVII.&mdash;Willenhall &ldquo;Spaw.&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It is difficult to imagine Willenhall as a health resort; yet
it was no fault of Dr. Richard Wilkes that his native spot did
not become a fashionable inland watering place.</p>
<p>It should be explained that during the eighteenth century
there was almost a mania to discover and exploit wells and
springs, and to regard them as fountains of health to which the
fashionable and the well-to-do might be attracted.&nbsp; Before
the newer fashion of sea bathing was introduced&mdash;which was
early in the next century&mdash;there was a great number of these
newly-invented places of inland resort.&nbsp; For instance,
Dudley had its charming Spa on Pensnett Chace; and to show that
Wolverhampton was not behindhand, we take the liberty of quoting
from the MSS. of Dr. Wilkes:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A medical spring has lately been discovered
at Chapel Ash, in the south-west part of this town, which purges
moderately and without the least uneasiness.&nbsp; A brown ocre,
or absorbent earth, remains after evaporation, mixt with salt and
sulphur; so that it seems to promise relief in all kinds of
disorders proceeding from costiveness, and alcaline, fiery, and
acid humours in the stomach and bowels, attended by a flow of
feverish heat, eruptions on the skin called scorbutic, headaches,
giddiness, flatulency, sour eructations, flying pains called
nervous and rheumatic, the hemorrhoids or piles, asthma, and many
other disorders which seem incurable by the most powerful
medicines.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly the Doctor might have earned a good living nowadays by
writing the advertisements for modern quack specifics.</p>
<p>Shaw&rsquo;s description of the Willenhall Spa says that
&ldquo;the spring arises on the north side of a brook which runs
almost directly from the west to the east, and so very near to it
that a moderate shower will raise the brook as to cover it.&nbsp;
About 200 yards up this brook, on the same side, are several
springs, one of which was much taken notice of by our ancestors,
and consecrated to St. Sunday, no common saint.&nbsp; Over it is
the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><!-- page 91--><a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Fons occulis
morbisque<br />
cutaneis diu celebris, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>
1726.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Saint Sunday&rdquo; must have been some local saint;
or, more probably, a jocular embodiment of the sacredness of this
day of the week with its peculiarly pagan name, to the cause of
idleness, and so dubbed by the native wit of Willenhall; anyway,
no saint of this name is to be found in the authorised Calendar
of any church.</p>
<p>One of the Wilkes MSS. utilised by Shaw, and dated 1737,
records the following experiment worked by the learned doctor
with the local mineral waters:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I evaporated in a brass furnace 13&frac12;
gallons to 3 quarts, then let it stand 3 days to settle, and
poured the clear water from the f&oelig;ces.&nbsp; This was a
light smooth insipid earth of a yellow colour, fat between the
fingers, insipid and impalpable, which being dried, weighed 93
grains.&nbsp; The remaining 3 quarts I evaporated in a brass
kettle and had from it 53 grains of a very salt glutinous
substance which dried into a solid mass of a brown colour.&nbsp;
When the water came to a pint or thereabout, it began to smell
like glew, and continued to do so when in a solid substance; it
was then also as high-coloured as lye; but I am afraid this
colour might arise from the brass kettle, in some measure, or too
great a fire, being perhaps burnt.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of his scientific records runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oct. 9th.&mdash;I put into a Florence flask
as much of this water as filled it up to the neck within 5 inches
of the top.&nbsp; This I placed in a sand heat and increased the
fire gradually till it boiled; and so I evaporated ad
siccitatem.&nbsp; Some volatile sal stuck to the glass even up to
the top; at the bottom was a small quantity of dark coloured
matter, like that above, but I could not get together 2 grains of
either.&nbsp; Here it is plain this sal is so volatile as to be
raised and fly away by heat.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another place he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;On the 5th of November, 1737, I filled
several glasses with this water, and put into them the following
simples:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>1.&nbsp; Green Tea.&nbsp; This, in about 24 hours, made
it of the colour of sack, and, by standing, it became much deeper
coloured, like strong old beer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Fustic; not so deep, more like cyder.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Red Sanders; almost the same colour in the light; but
if I held the glass in the shade, it appeared of a blueish green,
exactly like some old glass bottles I have formerly seen.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Alkanet; deeper, like old mountain wine.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Galls; paler than any of the foregoing.&nbsp; A large
blue scum on the top, such as we see upon urine in fevers, and
standing lakes of water, where there are minerals.&nbsp; With
logwood, tormentil, cort, granat, etc., there are some spots of
this kind, but with none so much as with galls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little below the Spaw (continues our authority), on
the other side of the brook, they meet with a white clay, full of
yellow veins of a deep colour, like gumboge when it has been for
some time exposed to the air.&nbsp; These two they temper
together and make into cakes, which they sell to the glovers by
the name of ochre cakes, and with them they give a yellow colour
to leather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near the surface of the earth the country is for the
most part a strong clay, which makes good brick, but, for a small
compass from this Spaw all along the village on the north side of
the brook we have sand.&nbsp; Underground the whole country
abounds with coal and ironstone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The glovers&rsquo; handicraft, it may be mentioned in passing,
was once strongly represented in olden Darlaston.</p>
<p>The situation of Willenhall is by no means an elevated one,
and the whole plain in which it is situated formerly abounded in
Springs, ere the surface had been so much disturbed by mining
operations.</p>
<p>On the edge of the valley, under the shadow of Sedgley Beacon,
was the famous Spring known as the Lady Wulfruna&rsquo;s, and
which gave the place its name, Spring Vale; from this spot the
silvery stream flowed eastwards into Willenhall, seeking the cool
shade of the pleasant woodland there.</p>
<p><!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>The stream, as it came in from Bilston, and ran
eastwards through Willenhall, till it met the Tame, was once
called the Hind Brook, or Stag River.&nbsp; In Saxon times the
Tame here seems to have been designated Beorgita&rsquo;s Stream;
and Mr. G. T. Lawley, in his &ldquo;History of Bilston,&rdquo;
says that the original bed of this brook was discovered in
Willenhall some years ago when extensive excavations were being
made.</p>
<p>So far the scientific aspect of this once famous Well.&nbsp;
The popular view of a much frequented mineral spring which had
&ldquo;long been celebrated for disease of the eye and
skin&rdquo; opens out an even wider aspect.&nbsp; As previously
mentioned, the brook flowing past it ran from west to east; a
stream so directed was always accounted by the Druids of old as a
sacred watercourse.&nbsp; Being thus from the earliest dawn of
history within sacred precincts, there can be little doubt the
Willenhall fountain enjoyed the reputation of a &ldquo;Holy
well&rdquo; for many centuries.&nbsp; As such it came in for the
annual custom of &ldquo;well dressing,&rdquo; a vestige of the
old pagan practice of well worship.&nbsp; Respecting this ancient
custom, Dr. Plot, writing in 1686 in his &ldquo;Natural History
of Staffordshire,&rdquo; says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They have a custom in this county, which I
observed on Holy Thursday at Brewood and Bilbrook, of adorning
their Wells with boughs and flowers; this it seems they do at all
gospel places, whether wells, trees, or hills, which being now
observed only for decency and custom&rsquo;s sake, is innocent
enough.&nbsp; Heretofore, too, it was usual to pay their respect
to such wells as were eminent for curing distempers (one of which
was at Wolverhampton in a narrow lane leading to a house, called
Sea-well; another at Willenhall; others at Monmore Green, near
Wolverhampton; at Codsall and many other parts of Staffordshire)
on the saint&rsquo;s day whose name the well bore; diverting
themselves with cakes and ale, and a little music and dancing;
which, whilst within bound, was also an innocent
recreation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Oliver says the beautiful spring at Dunstall was the
favourite resort of the Lady Wulfruna, and from contact with her
sanctity acquired a reputation for possessing healing virtues of
a <!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>miraculous character, and that this fountain was long
known among its devotees as Wulfruna&rsquo;s Well.</p>
<p>Pitt&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Staffordshire,&rdquo; issued in
1817, gives a long list of local wells bearing at that time some
similar repute for their remedial waters.&nbsp; Among them was
Codsall Well, near Codsall Wood, supposed in olden times to be
efficacious in cases of leprosy, and adjacent to which once stood
a Leper House, replaced at a later period by a &ldquo;Brimstone
Ale-house,&rdquo; so-called because the water was
sulphureous.&nbsp; The waters of the Monmore Green Well are
described as containing &ldquo;sulphur combined with
vitriol.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Sea-well Spring still retained its name
as a &ldquo;Spaw&rdquo; famous for its &ldquo;eye water&rdquo;;
while those of Willenhall and Bentley were said to yield a
valuable remedial sulphur water so long as they &ldquo;could be
kept from mixture with other waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Folklore not only connected these Wells with patron saints,
but associated their magic precincts and curative effects with
beneficent fairies.&nbsp; A well like that of Willenhall, which
in a post-renaissance period was honoured with a stone frontal
bearing a Latin inscription, would of a certainty be attended by
fairy elves in an earlier and more primitive era.</p>
<blockquote><p>About this Spring (if ancient fame say true)<br />
The dapper elves their midnight sports pursue;<br />
Their pigmy king and little fairy queen,<br />
In circling dances gambolled on the green,<br />
While tuneful sprites a merry concert made<br />
And airy music warbled through the shade.</p>

95</span>XVIII.&mdash;The Benefice.</h2>
<p>Owing to the meagreness of the record, a complete list of the
holders of the benefice is not to be expected.&nbsp; Thomas de
Trollesbury has been named as &ldquo;the parson of
Willenhall&rdquo; in 1297 (Chapter VII.); while we also have the
names of three chantry priests here&mdash;William in the Lone,
1341 (Chapter XI.); Thomas Browning, &ldquo;chaplain of the
chantry&rdquo; in 1397 (Chapter VII.); and Hugh Bromehall in 1526
(Chapter X.); all of them doubtless nominees of the Deanery of
Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>Of course, it was possible, though not often the practice, for
the holder of the living to act as &ldquo;chaunter&rdquo; priest
as well.&nbsp; The Chantry endowments, as we have seen, were
forfeited at the Reformation, at which period the benefice was
returned as of the annual value of &ldquo;&pound;10
clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Either of these notorious evil-livers mentioned in Chapter
XI., the non-preaching &ldquo;dumb-dogs,&rdquo; Mounsell and
Cooper, may have been the occupant of the Willenhall curacy in
1586.&nbsp; In 1609 an improvement in the intellectual status of
the holder had been effected, William Padmore, D.D., being then
incumbent.</p>
<p>In a previous chapter it was shown that the Rev. T. Badland
was expelled from the living of Willenhall in 1662.&nbsp; It can
now be shown that he was holding the benefice at least as early
as 1658&mdash;and possibly from the beginning of the Cromwellian
rule and the overthrow of the Episcopacy in 1646.</p>
<p>About 1645&ndash;6 ordinances were passed appointing a
Committee to consider ways and means of upholding and settling
the maintenance of ministers in England and Wales.&nbsp; In 1654
the powers of the Plundered Ministers&rsquo; Committee were
transferred to the Trustees for Maintenance.&nbsp; The Committee
took the receipts of all Tithes, Fifths, and First Fruits; and
later on the income of the rectories, bishoprics, deaneries, and
chapters; they sold the bishops&rsquo; lands, &amp;c.</p>
<p>It was out of this income that augmentations and advances were
granted by the said Committee to ministers and
school-masters.&nbsp; <!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>In the Record Office at London there
is an audited account the Treasurer to the &ldquo;Trustees for
the Maintenance of Ministers and other pious uses of
moneys,&rdquo; showing among the disbursements for the year
ending 26 December, 1658, one to</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thomas Badland, of Willenhall (6 months to
1659, March 25) . . . &pound;10.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In curious contrast with this high-minded clergyman, who
sacrificed his living to his conscience, is his successor in the
Curacy of Willenhall, the Rev. Mr. Gilpin, who had to be
seriously admonished for non-residence and other faults, and was
at last, in the year 1674, turned out of the living
altogether.&nbsp; Not improbably this gentleman was a pluralist,
an example of the class of clergymen by which the Church of
England was very much degraded at that period.</p>
<p>Dr. Oliver&rsquo;s history printed the following
&ldquo;Dismissal of the Rev. Thomas Gilpin,&rdquo; from the
original document found in the possession of Mr. Neve, of
Wolverhampton, in 1836:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>We, whose names are subscribed, the undoubted and
immediate lords of the Manor of Stow Health, hearing and well
weighing the said complaints of the Inhabitants of the towne of
Willenhall, lying within our said Manor, made and brought against
you, Thomas Gilpin, clerk, Curate of the Chapell there:</p>
<p>Doe in consideration thereof and in pursuance of an Order made
and inrolled on some of the Rolls of the Court of our said Manor,
bearing date 11th day of October in the Sixth Year of the Reign
of our late Soveraigne, Lord, King James, over England, etc.</p>
<p>And of our power and authority thereby, Displace and Discharge
you, the said Thomas Gilpin, from the place, Dignity, and office
of Curate, Minister, or Priest in the said Chapell.</p>
<p>And do hereby present and allow John Carter, clerk (a person
elected and approved by the Inhabitants of Willenhall aforesaid),
to be Curate of the said Chapell in your place <!-- page 97--><a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>and stead, to
read divine service there; and to do and perform all such other
offices and things as shall properly belong to his Ministerial
function and calling.</p>
<p>And thus much you, the said Thomas Gilpin, are hereby desired
to take notice of.</p>
<p>Dated under our hands and seals this 18th day of November in
the year of our Lord God, 1674, and in the six-and-twentieth year
of the reigne of our Soveraigne Lord, Charles II., by the grace
of God, King of England, etc.</p>

class="smcap">l.s.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: right">W. Leveson Gower.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">l.s.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the expulsion of Mr. Gilpin the Rev. John Carter, who
was appointed to succeed him, continued in the Curacy of
Willenhall till his death in 1722.&nbsp; In 1727 mention is made
of a Mr. Holbrooke being Curate of Willenhall.</p>
<p>Soon after the Registers assist in tracing the successive
holders of the benefice.&nbsp; Here are three interesting
memoranda, for instance, bearing the signature of the Rev. Titus
Neve:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>1748, March 4th.&mdash;The faculty for rebuilding
and enlarging ye chapel of Willenhall, ye then present minister,
ye Rev. Titus Neve&mdash;(to charge and receive certain fees,
etc.)</p>
<p>1750, January 20.&mdash;Then it was yt service began to be
performed in ye New Chapel, after almost two years
discontinuance, by Titus Neve, Curate.</p>
<p>1763, February 17th.&mdash;Joyce Hill made oath that ye body
of Benjamin Stokes was buried in a shroud of Sheep&rsquo;s Wool
only, pursuant to an Act of Parliament in that case made and
provided.&mdash;Witness my hand,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Titus Neve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(This entry has reference to the Act for Burying in Woollen,
one of those pieces of legislative folly whereby it was sought to
bolster up artificially our decaying trade in wool.)</p>
<p>The Rev. Titus Neve, whose descendants at the present day are
a well-known Wolverhampton family, was born at Much Birch in
Herefordshire, son of the Rev. Thomas Neve, in 1717.&nbsp; He
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>matriculated at Balliol College, Oxford, became Rector
of Darlaston, 1764, holding the two livings, together with the
Prebendary of Hilton his death in 1788.&nbsp; He was buried at
Willenhall.</p>
<p>A sermon preached by him in Worcester Cathedral on August
12th, 1762, was printed in Birmingham by the celebrated
Baskerville (see Simms&rsquo; &ldquo;Bibliotheca
Staffordiensis&rdquo;).</p>
<p>His successor was the Rev. William Moreton, who, according to
an entry in the Registers, was &ldquo;sequestered to the vacant
chapelry of Willenhall, December 4th, 1788.&rdquo;&nbsp; Toward
the close of his ministry Mr. Neve appears to have had the
assistance of Curates&mdash;George Lewis signs the Registers as
&ldquo;Clerk, Curate&rdquo; between December, 1778, and July,
1779; and the signature of Mr. Moreton in the same capacity
begins to appear in 1784.&nbsp; Among the entries of the
last-named is a record that in 1786 he paid the &ldquo;tax&rdquo;
on a number of Baptisms and Burials himself, whereas in 1785 he
shows that a &ldquo;Collector&rdquo; received it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The advent of the Rev. W. Moreton marks an epoch, and we now
turn aside to consider the peculiar history of the Advowson, or
right of presentation to the living of Willenhall.&nbsp; In 1409
it is found in private hands, being then the property of William
Bushbury and his wife (see Chapter VII.).</p>
<p>When the lord of a manor built a church on his own demesne, he
often appointed the tithes of the manor to be paid to the
officiating minister there, which before had been given to the
clergy in common; the lord who thus founded the church often
endowed it with glebe, and retained the power of nominating the
minister (canonically qualified) to officiate therein.&nbsp; But
a chapel-of-ease like Willenhall, built by a resident in the
locality, often had its minister, maintained by the subscriptions
of persons living close around it, and they naturally claimed to
elect their own ministers.&nbsp; The authorities at the mother
church would reserve the right to approve and confirm, and would
see that they suffered no loss of fees and other emoluments.</p>
<p><!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>An old book in the Registry at Windsor (without date)
contains this entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The curacy of Willenhall is endowed with land to
the value of &pound;35.&nbsp; The lords of Stow Heath have, in
the last two vacancies, usurped upon the Dean and Chapter, and
have nominated to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shaw, the county historian, writing in 1798, after stating
that whoever holds the Curacy of Willenhall must have a licence
from the Dean of Wolverhampton, proceeds to say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There has been lately a serious contest between
the Marquis of Stafford and the inhabitants about the nomination
of a curate.</p>
<p>The gift of the living (says the same authority), or
nomination of the minister or curate, is in the principal
inhabitants that have lands of inheritance here.&nbsp; He is to
be approved of by the lords of the manor, and admonished by them
when he does amiss; and if he does not amend in half a year, they
may turn him out and nominate another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This practice is believed to have existed in Willenhall since
the time of James I.</p>
<p>The power of the parishioners to elect their own clergymen,
though not common, exists in various parts of the country; as at
Hayfield and Chapel-in-le-Frith, both in Derbyshire; and in this
more immediate locality at St. John&rsquo;s Deritend, Birmingham,
and at Bilston and Bloxwich, nearer still.</p>
<p>In London the only example where the elective principle is
employed in the choice of a parish priest is presented by
Clerkenwell.&nbsp; But wheresoever a vacancy of the kind has to
be filled by popular election, with all the accessories
incidental to the turmoil of Parliamentary electioneering, all
the bitterness of party strife, the parish is inevitably divided
into two or more factions; while the clergyman upon whom the lot
eventually falls must for a long time afterwards be regarded as
the nominee of one of them, rather than the spiritual director of
the whole body of the people.&nbsp; He succeeds to his high
office as a victor in a great parochial struggle <!-- page
100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>which cannot fail to leave behind it those feelings of
rancour so harmful in matters sacred.</p>
<p>The only remedy for this state of things seems to be the
voluntary surrender of their privilege by the parishioners; or
the provisions of a special Act of Parliament.</p>
<p>As to the soundness of the general principle of a people being
consulted in the choice of their spiritual pastor, there can
scarcely be two opinions.&nbsp; But where the danger lurks in a
case like that of Willenhall is the assumption of our English
law&mdash;an assumption quite unwarranted in any country where
freedom of conscience exists, and with us one of the penalties
for maintaining an established State Church&mdash;that every
parishioner is a Churchman.</p>
<p>Now, as a matter of fact, votes are recorded at these
elections by Romanists, by Dissenters of various shades of
opinion, by those who are unattached to any religious
denomination, and by many who never, at other times, take a great
interest in Church of England affairs.&nbsp; At the last election
even trustees of Nonconformist chapels were empowered to vote if
they were householders, and the trust in respect of which they
qualified had been constituted by a properly executed deed.&nbsp;
So it can scarcely be claimed that the choice of minister rests
solely with those most concerned, namely, the congregation, the
customary worshippers at St. Giles&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p>Resuming the story of the benefice at the election of 1788, it
is said that Mr. Moreton having been elected, the then lords of
the manor declined to present him to the bishop on the ground
that they did not regard him as a fit and proper person.&nbsp;
Litigation ensued, and the High Court of Justice declared the
election void, and ordered a new one.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the income
seems to have sequestrated, probably lying in the hands of the
churchwardens till the new minister should be properly
instituted.</p>
<p>The electors for a second time returned Moreton, and the lords
of the manor then took up the attitude that it was not part of
their duty to live in litigation, either with the electors or
with Moreton; they had expressed their opinion of the man in the
strongest manner possible, and this they considered relieved them
<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>from further responsibility; so now at the
electors&rsquo; wish they nominated him to the bishop for
induction, and in due course he was formally inducted.</p>
<p>The new incumbent of Willenhall was popularly given out to be
an illegitimate &ldquo;nephew&rdquo; of George III.; he bore a
strong facial likeness to the Royal family, and had been at
college with the Duke of York.&nbsp; But whatever his origin or
extraction, he was a typical sporting parson of the old school,
an enthusiastic cock-fighter, and &ldquo;a three-bottle
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not long before the old mocking doggerel was applied to
Willenhall:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>A tumble-down church&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A tottering steeple&mdash;<br />
A drunken parson&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And a wicked people!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this old rhyme fairly described the condition of things
we may venture to believe if we can also accept as true the rhyme
oft quoted by this Willenhall worthy, and which was said to
embody his philosophy:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Let back and sides and head go bare,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let foot and hand go cold,<br />
But God send belly good ale enough,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether it be new or old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of &ldquo;Parson Moreton&rdquo; innumerable tales are told,
all of them racy, though not a few of them apochryphal.&nbsp;
There can be little doubt that in the later years of his life he
was a bon vivant, and indulged openly in the less refined sports
of the period, a cockfight above all things having a strong
fascination for him.</p>
<p>And yet, on the plea that &ldquo;a merciful man is good to his
beast,&rdquo; he indulged his old grey pony, &ldquo;Bob,&rdquo;
on which he regularly ambled about, with a share of every tankard
of ale he quaffed on his rounds, till the knowing quadruped
refused to pass any inn along the road for miles around without
stopping for refreshment.</p>
<p>Parson Moreton is not to be judged by modern standards.&nbsp;
At that time the church was asleep; and Dr. Johnson once declared
that he did not know one religious clergyman.&nbsp; Though the
Parson of Willenhall became noted throughout the countryside <!--
page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>for his eccentricities, he managed to labour among the
rough population, to whom he ministered, with some sort of
success.</p>
<p>Into all his lapses from the conventionalities of clericalism,
he was a gentleman at the core, having a dignified bearing and a
commanding presence.&nbsp; He candidly admitted his shortcomings
as a clergyman, telling his flock to do as he said, not as he
did.&nbsp; This naturally failed to satisfy very many of them;
and it has been asserted that the strength of Dissent in
Willenhall at the present time is directly due to the influence
of his incumbency.</p>
<p>Of the Rev W. Moreton, it may at least be said that he was a
remarkably fine reader, and his sermons were always
well-constructed compositions.&nbsp; For many years he lived with
Mr. Isaac Hartill in the house at the corner of the Market Place,
opposite the Metropolitan Bank; an old house still retaining its
original oak floors and staircase, and its substantial
old-fashioned doors of the same material, although the building
is now made into two shops.</p>
<p>For nearly fifty years Parson Moreton was a familiar figure in
the streets of Willenhall.&nbsp; His last signature in the
Registers appears in 1833, a year previous to which the Rev.
George Hutchinson Fisher had come into the parish to assist him,
taking up his residence in the house next to &ldquo;The Neptune
Inn,&rdquo; now the Police Station.&nbsp; He died July 16th,
1834, and was buried on Sunday the 20th.</p>
<p>When Mr. Fisher came to preach Mr. Moreton&rsquo;s funeral
sermon, the most notable feature of the oration was the absence
of direct reference to the departed.&nbsp; Towards the close of
the sermon, however, the following passage was uttered with
impressive solemnity:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;May every occasion like the present bring
instruction and edification to your souls.&nbsp; May the failings
which you have witnessed and lamented in others urge you to
examine and correct your own; and when their removal makes you
think on the nature of the account they will have to render, may
you be awakened to scrutinise your own stewardship; and instead
of recording the sins of the departed, seek to be delivered,
whilst the Redeemer invites you, from those which are a burden to
your consciences.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly a charitable and Christian-like obituary!</p>
<h2><!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>XIX.&mdash;How a Flock Chose its own
Shepherd.</h2>
<p>The living of St. Giles&rsquo;s, Willenhall, popularly
supposed to be worth some fourteen hundred pounds a year, the
reversion of it was looked upon with eager eyes by not a few of
the surrounding clergy.&nbsp; Between Darlaston and Willenhall,
particularly, there seems to have existed some sort of
pretensions to a clerical inter-relationship.</p>
<p>The Rev. Titus Neve, who held the living of Willenhall from
about 1748 to 1788, acted as Curate of Darlaston in 1760, and
became Rector of that parish in 1764; while his son, the Rev.
Charles Neve, was also Curate there from 1790 to 1793.&nbsp; The
Willenhall record of his ministry and interment runs:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Revd. Titus Neve, Minister, Curate, or
Stipendiary Priest of Willenhall Chapelry, Prebendary of Hilton
and Sacrist of the Collegiate Church of Wolverhampton, and Rector
of Darlaston, in the County of Stafford, departed this life
December 23rd, 1788, and was interred in the Chancel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His successor, the Rev. William Moreton, went as Curate to
Darlaston in 1786, and was sequestered to the vacant chapelry of
Willenhall, December 24th, 1788, the day following Mr.
Neve&rsquo;s decease.</p>
<p>At the termination of Mr. Moreton&rsquo;s tenure, the Rev.
George William White, who had been a curate at Darlaston from
1823, made a very determined bid for the Incumbency of
Willenhall; and although, as we shall see, he was not successful,
he was able to console himself, some nine years later, with the
rectory of Darlaston (1843).</p>
<p>It appeared that when the Rev. W. Moreton became very old he
neglected his duties sadly, often keeping funerals and
congregations waiting an unconscionable time, greatly to the
scandal of the whole parish.&nbsp; In consequence of this the
Churchwardens induced the Incumbent, two or three years before
his death, to appoint and pay an energetic young Curate to assist
him in his parochial ministrations.</p>
<p><!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>The Curate appointed under these circumstances, as
already mentioned, was the Rev. G. H. Fisher, who speedily became
a favourite, and by most Willenhall people came to be looked upon
as the only possible successor to Mr. Moreton.</p>
<p>Long before the advent of Mr. Fisher, however, the Darlaston
folk had settled in their own minds that their Rector, the Rev.
Mr. White, was to annex the Willenhall living whenever it become
vacant.&nbsp; Whether they looked upon it as being appurtenant to
the more important office of their own shepherding cannot be
determined at this distance of time; but certain it is that an
intense feeling of rivalry existed between the men of Darlaston
and the men of Willenhall.&nbsp; The intensity of the feeling may
best be judged by a remarkable incident which occurred some five
years before Mr. Fisher appeared on the scene.</p>
<p>During the earlier months of the year 1827 it would appear
that there had been, from time to time, incursions and alarms
between the two towns, and even rioting that involved hand to
hand fighting in the streets.&nbsp; Never were such exciting
times in these places.&nbsp; At last the rivalry culminated in an
act of aggression as daring in execution as it was original in
conception&mdash;the Willenhall men woke up one fine Sunday
morning to find that the Darlastonians had entered their town in
the dead of night and stolen the cock from the church
steeple!</p>
<p>Now the desperate achievement of this triumph over their
enemies had a deeper significance than at first meets the
eye.&nbsp; It must be borne in the mind that those were the old
cockfighting days, when town matched against town their gamest
birds, and sought the glories of a victory in the cock-pit.&nbsp;
As between these two neighbouring parishes in particular, there
had been much vaunting of birds and challenging to the
arbitrament of the spur; the Darlaston men would take a game cock
into Willenhall, hold him up to show him the weathercock on the
steeple, and then give vent to a roar of defiant laughter when
the bird crowed his challenge.</p>
<p>By way of reprisal the men of Willenhall would raid Darlaston,
and pretend to call the cock from the steeple there by <!-- page
105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>scattering corn in the churchyard, in mocking allusion
to an old tale of Darlastonian simplicity.&nbsp; No wonder,
therefore, that the ridiculed were at last exasperated beyond
endurance, and that the coup de main of stealing the Willenhall
cock was not only projected, but carried to its marvellously
successful issue.</p>
<p>Consternation reigned supreme in Willenhall; it was felt that
the pass to which matters had been brought by the enormity of
this latest aggravation by their enemies could only be met by an
appeal to the law, which, hitherto, both factions had so
recklessly set at naught.&nbsp; So the following public notice
was promptly issued:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">10 GUINEAS REWARD.</p>
<p>Whereas, early on Sunday morning last, some evil disposed
Persons did steal and carry away the</p>
<p style="text-align: center">WEATHERCOCK<br />
from off the<br />
STEEPLE.</p>
<p>Any Person giving Information so that the Offenders may be
apprehended, shall upon Conviction receive <span

allowed by the Association for the prosecution of Felons.&nbsp;
And as more than one were concerned, if either will impeach his
Accomplice or Accomplices, they shall receive the above Reward,
and every endeavour used to obtain a free Pardon.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Notice proved totally unproductive of results, for no
Darlaston man was found mean enough to betray the heroes of this
daring escapade.&nbsp; Therefore, as the trophy of Darlastonian
valour could not be recovered, and St. Giles&rsquo;s tower could
not be left in all its nakedness without being an ever-present
reproach to the <!-- page 106--><a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>Willenhallers, a new vane had
forthwith to be provided for the church.</p>
<p>It was some time after the Willenhall pride had been thus
lowered that the old weathercock was accidentally found by some
miners who were re-opening an old coal pit which lay between the
rival townships.&nbsp; Almost needless to say, the new vane was
instantly fetched down, and the old one once more set up to
flaunt itself as bravely as of yore in the eyes of distant
Darlaston.</p>
<p>The good folk of Willenhall, feeling humiliated, did all in
their power to cover up their shame by burying the episode in
oblivion; and to this day Willenhall men will deny that the
Darlastonians ever came and took away their church
weathercock.&nbsp; By way of throwing doubt upon the historical
accuracy of the incident, they point to the fact that the church
at that time had no spire; it is known, however, that a vane
surmounted the church tower, and there is evidence of the Reward
Notice, the loose wording of which is responsible for the use of
the term &ldquo;steeple&rdquo; to signify a tower.</p>
<p>The authenticity of the said Notice is always open to
investigation, for a framed copy of it still hangs in the Neptune
Inn, preserved as a curiosity.&nbsp; (This copy, probably the
only one in existence, bears intrinsic evidence of being a
genuine document, and is a treasured possession of the Baker
family, to whom the &ldquo;Neptune&rdquo; property belonged, the
paper having been discovered some fifty years ago in a piece of
old furniture, by Mr. Phillips, a connection of his family.)</p>
<p>Resuming the history of the benefice, it may be observed that
a doubt has been raised whether Mr. Moreton had to go through a
contested election in 1788, but there can be no doubt as to an
electoral struggle in 1834.&nbsp; Mr. Fisher soon found himself
drawn into the vortex of factional strife, for he was speedily
pounced upon by the home party, and very much against his will
adopted as their figure-head, if not their champion.</p>
<p>When, on the death of Mr. Moreton, the period of Election came
within measurable distance, the excitement became more intense;
the patriotic supporters of Mr. White invading the Willenhall
<!-- page 107--><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>territory day after day.&nbsp; Such challenging and
fighting, such threatenings and retaliations, surely never were
known; one faction had no sooner hurled its defiance at the other
than both incontinently plunged headlong into the mel&eacute;e,
and rioting once more raged fiercely through the public
streets.</p>
<p>Cracked sconces, broken noses, split ears and black eyes
resulted by the score; to which list of casualties must be added
the number of the half-drowned who had to be rescued from the
canal.&nbsp; Onslaughts made on public-houses and other party
headquarters led to a considerable destruction of property,
which, however, was borne with much complacency when it was
remembered that the whole Hundred would be called upon to pay the
bill.</p>
<p>Among the candidates for the Incumbency were the Rev. R.
Robinson, lecturer at the Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton, in
recommendation of whom Mr. G. B. Thorneycroft wrote a letter,
dating it from Chapel House in that town, 16 July, 1834; the Rev.
John Howells, the Rev. Mr. Rogers, the Rev. Mr. Gwyther, and the
Rev. Mr. Wenman; but the Rev. George Hutchinson Fisher, who had
been Curate two and a-half years in the town, was recognised as
the most formidable competitor.&nbsp; He was the son of a
headmaster of Wolverhampton Grammar School, and an M.A. (1834) of
Christ College, Cambridge.&nbsp; He received his nomination from
Mr. Jeremiah Hartill, and there was little doubt of his ability
to obtain the necessary approval of the lords of the manor and
the confirmatory licence of the Dean of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>At that time the Duke of Cleveland was impropriator, but the
tithes had been leased by his Grace to Messrs. James Whitehouse
and Charles Quinton.</p>
<p>As the day of battle approached public feeling ran so high
that on the eve of the poll, which took place on August 5th and
6th, 1834, the Returning Officer deemed it prudent to issue the
following Appeal to the Inhabitants:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>It is represented to me, from numerous quarters,
that the excitement of the approaching Nomination of a Minister
to your Chapel renders it imprudent to take the Poll at the time
and place appointed.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Gentlemen,&mdash;I cannot but hope and believe that
such fears are unnecessary; and, relying upon your good sense, I
have determined not to make any alteration in the present
arrangements.</p>
<p>I have no interest in your choice; it is my duty only to act
with impartiality between all parties.</p>
<p>For that purpose I shall be at your Church at Ten
O&rsquo;clock To-morrow Morning, but unless every person entitled
to vote has free and Unmolested Access to the Poll, I shall, of
course, be under the <span class="smcap">necessity</span> of
adjourning it.</p>
<p>I address myself to the friends of Each Candidate Alike, and
entreating you to allow the proceedings of the day to take place
with that moderation which their object and the sacred place in
which we shall meet so particularly require.</p>
<p>I am, Gentlemen,<br />
Your faithful, humble Servant,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Francis
Holyoake</span>.</p>
<p>Tettenhall, August 4, 1834.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, all this rowdyism and disgraceful violence
were sternly reprobated by Mr. Fisher, whose rabid opponents must
have come to realise that their cause was a lost one when they
waylaid the polling clerk and tore his poll-book to shreds.</p>
<p>As to the Magistrates and the Constables, the custodians of
the peace discreetly pursued a policy of the most masterly
inactivity.&nbsp; Perhaps they felt that the resources of their
command were totally inadequate to cope with an uprising of the
dimensions and intensity which presented themselves to their
consideration; or, maybe, they philosophically recognised that
these stirring tumults were the inevitable concomitants of a
parochial struggle of so momentous a character.&nbsp; Anyway,
their attitude appears to have been justified when everything
settled down quietly after the election, the Fisheries
tranquilised by victory, and the White Boys dejected by
defeat.</p>
<p>For the voting resulted easily in favour of Mr. Fisher, though
the validity of his return was challenged in the Court of
Chancery for some three years afterwards, during which time,
however, <!-- page 109--><a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>he had no hesitation in
officiating.&nbsp; He was a fine reader and an able speaker, his
delivery of the Church ritual being a model of correct
elocution.</p>
<p>Like his predecessor, he held the living a long time, the
tenure of the two covering a century.&nbsp; Mr. Fisher resided
for a number of years at Bentley Hall.</p>
<p>In 1887, soon after Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jubilee&rdquo;
in Willenhall, a public movement was instituted, in which many
Dissenters took part, to acknowledge his fifty years of devoted
service among all classes of the community.&nbsp; A presentation
was made to him of a silver service and his portrait in
oils&mdash;the latter the work of Thomas Hill, a native of
Wednesfield, and which now hangs on the walls of the Free Public
Library.</p>

<h2><!-- page 110--><a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>XX.&mdash;The Election of 1894, and
Since.</h2>
<p>Although St. Giles&rsquo;s Church is known as the Parish
Church, and a church has probably been on the same site some six
centuries, the church of Willenhall is really a Proprietary
Chapel of Ease, and its Incumbent legally nothing more than a
Perpetual Curate, or Curate in Charge, though Incumbent of
Willenhall, and receiving in respect of that office a very
substantial &ldquo;living.&rdquo;&nbsp; The official return set
forth in Crockford&rsquo;s Clergy Directory for 1893 was: Tithe
rent charge, &pound;640, net Income, &pound;1,300.</p>
<p>Strictly, there is no St. Giles&rsquo;s parish, nor any parish
attached to St. Giles&rsquo;s Church, and in law the Incumbent
might, if he wished, ignore the so-called parish so long as he
performed satisfactorily certain duties in the church.&nbsp; The
unappropriated district, commonly known as St. Giles&rsquo;s
parish, includes that part of Willenhall which has not been
allocated to the properly constituted parishes (or ecclesiastical
districts) of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, St. Anne&rsquo;s, and Holy
Trinity, Short Heath, plus the entire civil parish of
Bentley&mdash;the whole being really part of the ecclesiastical
parish of Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>The position is extraordinarily anomalous.&nbsp; The Incumbent
is elected by the inhabitants of the township of Willenhall being
sufficient householders and having lands of inheritance there;
that is to say, the voters must be freeholders as well as
householders.&nbsp; Litigation followed the choice of the Rev.
William Moreton in 1788, and also the election of the Rev. G. H.
Fisher in 1834.&nbsp; It is understood that this system of
&ldquo;patronage&rdquo; has been condemned by the Privy Council;
and that application has been made for the proper constitution of
a St. Giles&rsquo;s parish, but the Bishop demands a quid pro
quo.</p>
<p>All attempts to create a Parish of Willenhall have, so far,
utterly failed.&nbsp; The existing system of patronage is always
the obstacle, and nothing will induce the voters either to sell
or to surrender their rights in the Advowson.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>To fully realise the position it must be borne in mind
that in addition to the three constituted &ldquo;parishes&rdquo;
created within the original township of Willenhall since Mr.
Fisher became Incumbent of Willenhall in 1834, Short Heath is now
a separate township, with separate District Council, and that
Bentley has its Rural District Council&mdash;so that persons who
live in Bentley parish, Short Heath parish, the three constituted
ecclesiastical district parishes or districts, and the
unappropriated remainder of the township (nominally St.
Giles&rsquo;s parish), have all the right to vote for the
clergyman if they have the necessary other qualifications of
householder and freeholder.</p>
<p>On the death of the Rev. G. H. Fisher in 1894, no less than 23
formal applications were forthcoming for the vacant living.&nbsp;
The keynote was given at a preliminary meeting of St.
Giles&rsquo;s congregation, at which Dr. J. T. Hartill presided,
and when the most likely candidates were formally proposed and
seconded for adoption.</p>
<p>The voting (recorded on cards) resulted in favour of the Rev.
William Elitto Rosedale, M.A., Rector of Canton, Cardiff, for
whom there were 265, as against 26 given for the Rev. W. L. Ward,
of St. Anne&rsquo;s, Willenhall.&nbsp; The Churchwardens
consistently directed the procedure at this public election as
nearly as possible along the lines which would be followed by
private patronage; they declined to take any active part in the
circulation of testimonials, or afford facilities for any
candidate to preach in the church, to the possible prejudice of
the others, but they passively acquiesced in each one approaching
the electors in any way which seemed fitting and proper to
himself.</p>
<p>The votes recorded on this occasion were:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>Rev. W. E. Rosedale (Canton, Cardiff)</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">199</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Rev. F. W. Ford (London)</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">1</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock, Mr. Page (who was the son of a local
iron-master) and Mr. Ford retired in favour of Mr. Ward.&nbsp;
The Returning Officer was Mr. R. N. Hearne, Steward to the Lords
of <!-- page 112--><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>the Manor of Stowheath, the Duke of Sutherland and Mr.
W. T. C. Giffard; and the poll was taken by open voting, each
voter recording his vote orally and within the hearing of all
present.</p>
<p>The result having been forwarded to the Lords of the Manor,
they formally nominated the one at the head of the poll to the
Bishop for appointment and induction to the living.&nbsp; The
successful candidate was a native, being the son of the Rev. D.
Rosedale, to whose exertions the building of Holy Trinity Church
was largely due, and in the Vicarage House attached to which the
said candidate was born.&nbsp; But he possessed other than local
claims, though these, no doubt, prepossessed many Willenhall folk
in his favour.</p>
<p>There can be little doubt the election of 1894 was conducted
with far more tact and discretion than ever had been exercised on
similar occasions previously.&nbsp; There was still the old risk
of serious public disturbances; but perhaps more than ever there
was, as must generally be the case in such methods of conducting
a controversial matter of this description, the danger of
unseemly and acrimonious squabblings in public.&nbsp; It reflects
the highest credit upon the Churchwardens and all others
concerned in the election, that not only was nearly all this
avoided, but the possibility always present, of long and
embittered litigation to follow, was also reduced to a
minimum.&nbsp; It required some firmness and decision to weed
down 23 formal applications, and more than twice that number of
business-like inquiries, to workable limits for taking a
poll.</p>
<p>The litigation of 1834 had arisen through the manufacture of
&ldquo;faggot votes,&rdquo; which were eventually disallowed, and
had to be struck off.&nbsp; A difficulty arose in 1894 as to the
interpretation of an Act of 1844&mdash;would Lord
Blandford&rsquo;s Act debar from taking part in the voting the
residents in the newly-created ecclesiastical districts of St.
Stephen&rsquo;s, St. Anne&rsquo;s, and Holy Trinity, Short
Heath?&nbsp; Although at first dubious on the question, the
authorities answered it in the negative.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>As previously stated, the earliest record of the Advowson is
of the year 1408.&nbsp; In the Salt Collections, Vol.&nbsp; XI.,
p. 218, we <!-- page 113--><a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>find that by a final concord
recorded &ldquo;on the morrow of St. Martin, 10 Henry IV.,
William Bysshebury and Joan, his wife, acknowledged that seven
messuages, eight tofts, one mill, sixty acres of land, ten acres
of meadow, and 24s. 6&frac12;d. of rent in Wolverhampton, and the
Advowson of the Chapel of Willenhall to be the right of Richard
Hethe and William Prestewood, chaplain, and the latter granted
them to William Bysshebury and Joan for their lives, with
remainder to John Hampton, of Stourton, and Harvise, his wife,
and to the heirs of John for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exactly two centuries later, as we shall learn in the next
chapter, the endowments of, and the right of presentation to, the
living were placed upon a definite and legal foundation.&nbsp;
Suffice it here to say that at the present time there are
Trustees appointed by the Charity Commissioners for the purpose
of holding the Trust property belonging to the said living, and,
with the assistance of an official representing the
Commissioners, managing affairs connected therewith.</p>
<p>The Trust, to which Mr. Samuel Mills Slater is solicitor, is
under the full control of the Charity Commissioners, who have to
be regularly supplied with certified copies of all the Trust
accounts.</p>
<p>As we shall see presently, the original Feoffees of the Trust
property were appointed in 1608 by a Commission of local magnates
and landowners, consisting of William Overton, Bishop of
Lichfield; William, Lord Paget, of Beaudesert; Sir John Bowes, of
Elford; Sir Edward Littleton, of Pillaton Hall; Sir Edward Leigh,
of Rushall; Sir Simon Weston, of St. John&rsquo;s, Lichfield; Sir
Robert Stanford, of Perry Hall; Sir Walter Chetwynde, of Grendon
and Ingestre; Sir William Chetwynde, of Grendon (half-brother of
Sir Walter); Zachary Babington, Doctor in the Civil Law; Raphe
Snead, of Keele; Walter Bagott, of Blythfield; William
Skeffington, of Fisherwick; Roger Fowke, of Brewood and Wyrley;
John Chetwynde, of Rudge, parish of Standon, and Walter Stanley,
of West Bromwich&mdash;most of them justices for the county of
Stafford.</p>
<p>By virtue of a provision in the Decree or award of these
Commissioners, the surviving Feoffees were enabled to appoint new
<!-- page 114--><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>Feoffees in the places of the deceased ones.&nbsp; In
later times, however, by virtue of the Charitable Trusts Acts,
the Board of Charity Commissioners acquired the power of making
appointments of new Trustees, and also of removing Trustees.</p>
<p>In the year 1889, the number of Trustees had become reduced to
one&mdash;Mr. John Davies, then residing at Warwick.&nbsp; By an
Order dated 23rd July, 1889, the Board removed Mr. Davies, at his
own request, from the office of Trustee, and appointed the
following gentlemen to be new Trustees:&mdash;</p>
<p>John Clark.</p>
<p>Wm. Henry Hartill.</p>
<p>John Thomas Hartill.</p>
<p>Joseph Johnson.</p>
<p>David Wm. Lees.</p>
<p>Jas. Carpenter Tildesley.</p>
<p>Henry Vaughan.</p>
<p>Henry Hartill Walker, junr.</p>
<p>Of these gentlemen only Messrs. J. T. Hartill, Vaughan, and
Walker are now living.</p>
<p>It might be necessary under certain conditions (as, for
instance, in any action connected with the sale of the Advowson)
to constitute a body of elected Trustees (as distinct from the
aforementioned nominated Trustees) of not more than eleven, nor
less than five members, duly elected at a statutory meeting of
the town&rsquo;s inhabitant freeholders.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, a public meeting of the owners of the
Advowson, convened on the requisition of a memorial to the
Incumbent (Rev. W. E. Rosedale), signed by a number of them, was
held in the month of June, 1900, to consider a proposal for the
sale of the said Advowson.&nbsp; A similar proposal had been
discussed in 1898 at a public meeting attended by some 200
owners, when it was suggested that half the sum realised should
be handed over to the town authorities, while the other half
should be spent on the church and schools.</p>
<p>At this second meeting, over which Mr. T. Nicholls, chairman
of the District Council, presided, the sale value of the Advowson
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>was variously estimated at sums ranging from
&pound;1,100 to &pound;3,000.&nbsp; The minister&rsquo;s income
was stated by one speaker to be &pound;539 per annum
nett&mdash;&pound;508 derived from a sum of &pound;20,974 13s.
11d. invested in Consols, and with other sources making a gross
revenue of &pound;641 18s. 9d., from which deductions amounting
to &pound;102 7s. 6d. had to be made.</p>
<p>Another speaker gravely cautioned the meeting against
over-estimating the capitalised value of this living by remarking
that the present incumbent was then a comparatively young man of
only forty-two, and healthy at that.</p>
<p>It was given as the opinion of another speaker that the
existing method of electing their parson was undesirable in the
best interests of the church, and ought to be forthwith
discontinued.&nbsp; Also it was contended that if a sale could be
effected, any sum that resulted therefrom might very
advantageously be expended in the town for the benefit of the
inhabitants generally.</p>
<p>One stalwart stickler for &ldquo;the eternal fitness of
things&rdquo; upheld the sound principle of the members of every
church exercising the right to choose their own minister, and he
deprecated generally the practice of trafficking in
advowsons.</p>
<p>In the end, although those in favour of selling almost
threatened to apply for an Act of Parliament for effecting a sale
compulsorily, the meeting finally resolved by a very substantial
majority: &ldquo;That it was not advisable at the present time to
sell the Advowson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that two well-conducted public meetings, held within a
brief space of each other, were unable to come to any definite
decision by which the position of things would be materially
altered.</p>
<h2><!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>XXI.&mdash;Willenhall Church
Endowments.</h2>
<p>By the courtesy of Mr. S. M. Slater, of Darlaston, a
summarised, but fairly comprehensive account of the Willenhall
endowments, and the somewhat exceptional parochial privileges
connected therewith, may be given here.</p>
<p>The foundation of the Endowment of the Benefice and the
establishment of the right of the Parishioners, or rather the
Parishioners of the Township &ldquo;having lands of inheritance
there,&rdquo; may be said to rest upon, or at all events to have
been defined and regulated by, three documents,
namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>(a) A Decree dated the 27th March in the 5th Year of James the
1st (1607), made in pursuance of an Inquisition, or Commission,
issued by the King on the 12th February of the previous (regnal)
year.</p>
<p>(b) A Deed of the 23rd September of the 6th Year of James the
1st (1608), entered into between the Lords of the Manor of
Stowheath on the one hand, and Sir Walter Levison and others, on
behalf of themselves and the rest of the Inhabitants of
Willenhall, on the other hand.</p>
<p>(c) A Memorandum entered on the Court Rolls of the Manor of
Stowheath, dated the 10th October in the 6th Year of James the
First (1608).</p>
<p>Reference to Chapter VII. of this work will recall how a
Chantry Chapel had been founded and endowed in Willenhall by the
Gerveyse family.&nbsp; This Chantry Chapel would be a
&ldquo;separated place&rdquo; within the Chapel-of-Ease specially
used to celebrate masses for the departed souls of certain
persons.&nbsp; Now, one of the earliest signs of the approaching
Reformation was a decline in the belief in Purgatory; and
presently Henry VIII. was empowered by Act of Parliament to seize
all lands, tenements, rents, &amp;c., which had been given for
the maintenance of Chantry Priests, with all their lamps,
candles, torches, and other expensive appointments for what were
declared to be &ldquo;superstitious&rdquo; uses.&nbsp; But a
right was reserved to the King, as head of the Church, to direct
<!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>such properties to uses which could be regarded as
truly &ldquo;charitable.&rdquo;&nbsp; What became of the
Willenhall Chantry endowments?</p>
<p>It is the opinion of Mr. A. A. Rollason, no mean authority on
the subject&mdash;vide his recondite articles in the
&ldquo;Dudleian,&rdquo; having special reference to a similar
Commission of Inquiry held in 1638 as to the alienation of lands
belonging to Dudley Grammar School&mdash;that the Willenhall
Inquisition, or Commission of Inquiry, was brought about, as was
that at Dudley, in consequence of the uncertain state of the law
as to whether the lands, and the income therefrom, came within
the Charitable Uses Act; or whether the gifts were absolutely
void.</p>
<p>For while Magna Charta declared &ldquo;that if any one shall
give lands to a religious house, the grant shall be void, and the
land forfeited to the lord of the fee&rdquo;&mdash;the abbots of
old took care to be &ldquo;lords of the fee,&rdquo; usually
holding their lands direct from the King&mdash;there was a
Statute of Edward III. by which the King was empowered to grant a
Royal licence affording relaxation of lands held under the
Statutes of Mortmain.</p>
<p>It seems almost impossible to doubt that the freehold lands
belonging to the Willenhall Chantry had escaped confiscation to
the Crown under the Statute, <span class="smcap">i</span> Edward
VI., if they had been held solely for performing obits and
singing masses for the dead.&nbsp; Yet it is just possible they
may have been re-granted to aid in the maintenance of the Curate
of the Chapel-of-Ease, in which case they would be recognised as
a &ldquo;charitable use,&rdquo; and were consequently safe.</p>
<p>The Willenhall Inquisition of 1607 was addressed by the King
(as stated in the last chapter) to &ldquo;The Reverend Father in
God, William, Bishopp of Coventrie and Lichfield And to our right
trustie and well beloved William Lord Pagett and to our trustie
and well beloved Sir John Bowes, Sir Edward Littleton, Sir Edward
Leigh, Sir Simon Weston, Sir Robert Stanford, Sir Walter
Chetwynde and Sir William Chetwynde, Knights, Zacharie Baington
(Babington), Doctor of Lawe, Chancellor of Lichfield, Raphe
Sneade, Walter Bagott, William Skevington (Skeffington), Roger
Fowke, John Chetwynde, and Walter Stanley, Esquires.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>It set forth that the King, for the due execution of a
certain Statute of 43 Queen Elizabeth, intituled an Act to
&ldquo;redress the misimployment of landes goods and stocks of
money theretofore given to charitable uses,&rdquo; and having
special trust and confidence in their approved fidelities,
&amp;c., had appointed the persons named &ldquo;to be our

<p>The Decree before referred to was signed by Sir Edward Leigh,
Dr. Zacharie Babington, William Skeffington, John Chetwynde, and
Walter Stanley, and was addressed to the Right Honourable Thomas,
Lord Ellesmere, Lord Chancellor of England.&nbsp; It set out the
Commission and then proceeded as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Wee therefore by verteue of the said Commission

full value thereof upon and towards the maynetaynance of a Curate

</blockquote>
<p>As will be seen, the Decree states clearly that the yearly
income of the Bentley lands was to be used towards the
maintenance of a Curate to say Divine Service in the Chapel; this
at once brought it under the Charitable Uses Act, and removed it
from liability to be confiscated under 23, Henry VIII., c. 10.,
for perpetuating practices regarded as superstitious and contrary
to Reformation doctrines.&nbsp; It will be noted that a
&ldquo;former feoffment&rdquo; is mentioned&mdash;may not this
have been a re-grant by the King, which has been hinted at?&nbsp;
The grant to Nicholas Hellyn and others in 4 Edward VI. has all
the appearance of being a gift from the Crown to the purposes of
the newly constituted Church of England.</p>
<p>The Decree then proceeds, as mentioned in the last chapter, to
make provision for the filling up of vacancies in the number of
Feoffees whenever the number may be reduced to three.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that the Inquisition and Decree, as given
above, deal only with the title to and the application of the
income of certain freehold lands at Bentley.&nbsp; The Deed of
the 23rd September of the 6th Year of James the 1st (1608), and
the Memorandum of the 10th October of the same year, however,
appear to deal with what seems to be the remainder of the
endowment of the Curacy, and with the status of the Priest or
Curate.&nbsp; The Deed and the Memorandum set forth, in effect,
the same set of facts; and the former may be described as the
Contract out of Court between the parties interested, and the
latter as being the Official Record of the Contract entered upon
the Rolls of the Manor.&nbsp; The Deed is stated to be made
between the Right Worshipful Sir John Levison, Knight, of
Lilleshall, in the County of Salop, and John Giffard, of
Chillington, in the County of Stafford, Esquire, on the one part,
and Sir Walter Levison, of Wolverhampton, Knight, Thomas Lane, of
Bentley, Esquire, Richard Wilkes, and Thomas Tomkis, of
Willenhall, Gentlemen, and William Brindley and William Podmore,
of Willenhall, <!-- page 122--><a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Yeomen, on behalf of themselves and
the rest of the Inhabitants of Willenhall, on the other part; and
after making reference to a &ldquo;Commission awarded upon the
Statute of 43 Elizabeth concerning Lands given to Charitable
Uses,&rdquo; it proceeds to state that the lords consent, grant,
and decree that the Copyhold lands therein referred to shall be
let in the manner and for the purpose therein mentioned, and the
effect of such consent, as before pointed out, is recited in the
Memorandum entered on the Court Rolls.</p>
<p>Coming to the Memorandum of 1608, it is evident a serious
difficulty had arisen with the Willenhall lands held under
copyhold tenure, and which were probably dealt with by the same
Commission.&nbsp; For there was probably but one Commission of
Inquiry, though there may have been two separate Decrees.</p>
<p>Lands held by Copyhold tenure are usually subject to fealty to
the Lord of the Manor, and this was doubtless customary in
Stowheath.&nbsp; It seems conclusive that the King did not take
these lands into his own hands, whereby matters would have been
reduced to the absurdity of the lord paramount being called upon
to do homage to his own tenant.</p>
<p>The suggestion is offered by Mr. Rollason that the tenure of
the lands was not precisely a lay one, but partook of a spiritual
nature&mdash;was, in fact, not feudal, but what was known as a
tenure in frankalmoign or free alms.</p>
<p>The Memorandum commences with a recital as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Whereas by a Commission awarded upon a Statute of
43 Elizabeth concerning Lands given to Charitable Uses upon the
executinge of wch Comission the Inhabitants and Men of Willenhall

</blockquote>
<p>The disclosure here made, that part of the endowments went to
the repair of the church, gives the key to the probable solution;
because this unquestionably constituted a &ldquo;charitable
use,&rdquo; and where such was intermixed with a
&ldquo;superstitious use,&rdquo; only so much as went to the
latter purpose was subject to confiscation under the reforming
Statutes of Henry VIII.&nbsp; A generous interpretation would not
inquire too closely into the amount left for a Chantry Priest,
and the portion devoted to repairs of the fabric.&nbsp; It was to
discriminate between the two kinds of uses that the subsequent
Statute of Elizabeth (43 E. Cap. 4) was passed, empowering the
Lord Chancellor to appoint Commissions authorised to investigate
the complaints of aggrieved parties, and to alter the direction
of the endowment funds, where necessary, to make them conformable
with the Protestant religion.&nbsp; This was precisely the nature
and function of the Willenhall Commission.&nbsp; All it
accomplished was done under the authority of the Great Seal of
England, the Commissions being generally directed by the Lord
Chancellor to the Bishop of the diocese, as in this case; the
judgments arrived at, and the decrees issued were given the full
force of law.&nbsp; The Willenhall Trust was clearly constituted
under this Act of Elizabeth.</p>
<p>On reading the introductory portion of the Memorandum, it will
be observed that no date is given to the Commission referred to,
which possibly might be interpreted to mean that such Commission
was quite separate from the one above set out, inasmuch as the
latter related only to freehold land at Bentley, while the
Memorandum speaks of &ldquo;certain Copyhold lands in the Towne
of Willenhall&rdquo; being &ldquo;surrendered by certain Feoffees
. . .&nbsp; Uppon trust,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>In the documents before considered no allusion is made to
there being any endowment or provision for the maintenance of the
Chantry Priest or Curate other than the income from the Freehold
<!-- page 126--><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>and Copyhold lands which respectively formed the
subject of those documents; and from this it is reasonable to
conclude that such income formed, or was involved in what may be
described as practically the only permanent provision for the
maintenance of the Incumbent for the time being of the
Chapel.</p>
<p>A century ago there appears to have been a prevalent belief
that the income of the Incumbent or Curate was about &pound;1,400
per annum.&nbsp; An investigation of what has happened during the
last 70 years does not reveal any foundation for the
belief.&nbsp; After the election, in the year 1838, of the late
Rev. G. H. Fisher to the Curacy, it was considered by him and the
Trustees of the Living to be desirable to apply to Parliament for
powers to sell the surface of the lands forming the Endowment, or
to sell or lease any of the mines thereunder.&nbsp; Accordingly,
a private Act of Parliament (7 and 8 Victoria Cap. 19) granting
those powers was obtained.&nbsp; The Preamble of this Act refers
to dealings with the Copyhold Lands subsequent to the date of the
Memorandum before commented upon, there being recitals that, as
appears by a surrender dated the 21st November, 1727, certain
Copyhold Lands, &amp;c., in the Town of Willenhall were formally
surrendered to the use of certain Feoffees and were held upon the
trusts already described, and that at a Court Baron held on the
24th September, 1839, the said Copyhold lands were surrendered to
the use of Thomas Hinks, John Riley Hinks, John Read, William
Stokes, John Mason, Joseph Turner, John Biddle, Jeremiah Hartill
and John Davies on the same trusts.&nbsp; The Preamble further
shows a small further source of income for the Living, inasmuch
as it states that certain Freehold lands in the Township of
Willenhall (as well as those in the Township of Bentley) had from
time immemorial been held and enjoyed in like manner as the said
Copyhold lands and that the said Freehold and Copyhold lands
constituted &ldquo;one and the same Charity.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Preamble further states that there stood in the name of the
Accountant-General of the High Court of Chancery the sum of
&pound;386 3s. 0d. of three per cent. Consols, and that there was
owing from the Birmingham Canal Company a sum of &pound;202 2s.
0d.&nbsp; These two sums represented the agreed prices of lands
belonging to the Living taken by <!-- page 127--><a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the Grand
Junction Railway Company and the Canal Company respectively under
their compulsory powers.&nbsp; The freehold land in Willenhall
before referred to, is comprised (with all the other lands held
in Trust for the Living), in the Schedule to the Act, and
consisted of a field called Ell Park, containing 1a. 3r. 28p.,
and produced a rental of &pound;5 12s. 0d.</p>
<p>Touching the supposition before referred to as to the value of
the Living being &pound;1,400 per annum, it may be mentioned that
the Schedule to the Act gives the total area of the lands held in
trust for the Living at 112a. 2r. 37p., and the aggregate amount
of the rentals as being &pound;500 15s. 6d. per annum.</p>
<p>A further power sought for and conferred by the Act was the
power to raise a sum not exceeding &pound;1,600 to be applied in
building a Parsonage House upon any of the land belonging to the
Living, or, in the alternative, to purchase at a cost not
exceeding &pound;1,600, a Parsonage House, with the consent of
the Court of Chancery, if thought more advantageous than to build
one.</p>
<p>In the exercise of the powers conferred by the Act, the
Trustees, in the course of a few years, sold all the lands
belonging to the Living situate in Willenhall, and in recent
years a piece of land containing 1 rood and 23 perches, forming
part of the Freehold land at Bentley, has also been sold and
there now remains at Bentley, belonging to the Living, nine
pieces of land, containing a total area of 30 acres and 27
perches, which, for several years prior to Mr. Fisher&rsquo;s
death, produced a rental of &pound;20 per annum.</p>
<p>The primary provisions of the Act with regard to the moneys to
arise from sales and leases under the powers thereby conferred
were: (a) That the moneys should be let out and invested under
the direction of the Court in the purchase of Freehold
hereditaments or Copyhold hereditaments convenient to be enjoyed
therewith; (b) that the premises purchased should be conveyed
unto the Trustees for the time being of the Charity and held upon
the Trusts, upon which the hereditaments sold would have been
held in case the same had not been so sold, and the Act had not
been passed; (c) that until the moneys should be so let out <!--
page 128--><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>and invested they should be invested in Parliamentary
stocks or Funds of Great Britain in the name of the
Accountant-General; and (d) that the annual produce of such funds
should be applied to the person and for the purposes to which the
rents of the trust lands would have been applicable.</p>
<p>In the exercise of the trust for purchasing lands conferred by
the Act, the Trustees subsequently purchased the property in
Walsall Street, adjoining and near to the Churchyard, including
the site of the new Schools there, and also two Cottages and some
gardens and land at Shepwell Green.&nbsp; The latter property has
since been sold off.</p>
<p>Reverting to the question of the value of the Living, it may
be mentioned that in the year 1886, when the Shepwell Green
property and the small piece of land at Bentley were still in
hand, the gross income from the Living, apart from Surplice Fees,
was &pound;792 7s. 9d., made up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>This statement brings matters up to date (1907); the tithes

The Daughter Churches.</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the nineteenth century a Royal Commission
was appointed to inquire into, and put a stop to, the barefaced
robbery of the Church charities, which had been going on for a
century or more.&nbsp; Every parish in England was visited, and
the Report on the Willenhall Charities was published in 1825 to
the following effect:&mdash;</p>
<h3>1.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prestwood&rsquo;s
Dole</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>An ancient Instrument was produced to us,
purporting to be a Deed-poll (without any seals thereto, but with
a portion of the lower margin torn off, not, however, as it
appeared to us, in that part where the seals are usually
affixed), bearing date 17 August, 1642, whereby William
Prestwood, of Willenhall, in Co. Stafford, and Mariana, his wife,
granted to the Wardens and Sidemen of the Church or Chapel of
Willenhall, aforesaid, and to the Overseers of the poor of the
said Town, and their successors for ever, all the annual rent,
profits, and emoluments whatsoever, issuing, renewing, and
arising from, in and out of a certain Close of the said William
and Mariana, called Canne Byrch, lying and being in Willenhall
aforesaid, between Willenhall Field on one part, and the highway
leading towards Darlaston on the other; to have and to hold all
the rent, profits, and emoluments arising from the said Close,
after the death of the said William and Mariana, for ever; to the
pious use following, viz.:&mdash;</p>
<p>To pay and contribute the annual rent aforesaid to the use and
behoof of the Poor in the said Town, at the discretion of the
aforesaid Wardens, Officers, and Overseers of the Chapel and Town
aforesaid for ever, and not otherwise: And it is further declared
that the said rent should be annually paid in the manner and form
as the said William by his last Will should appoint.</p>
<p>We have no evidence that this piece of land, which is well
known, was ever in the possession of the Parish Officers.&nbsp;
<!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>It is now considered as the property of Hervey Smith,
Esq., of Castle Bromwich, who has lately succeeded to it on the
death of his father, the late William Smith, Esq., solicitor of
Birmingham, and to be subject only to an annual rent charge of
20s. to the Poor of Willenhall, which is regularly paid by the
tenant of the land.&nbsp; It has been for many years in the
possession of Mr. Smith&rsquo;s family, and he produced several
receipts, the earliest of which is dated 31 October, 1753, and is
for &ldquo;&pound;1 due Nov. 1st, 1753, for Prestwood&rsquo;s
Dole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others are for the same sum, designating it either as
&ldquo;Prestwood&rsquo;s Dole,&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Dole payable to
the Poor of Willenhall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We do not conceive that, under these circumstances, the
imperfect Instrument above stated, unaccompanied by possession,
can afford any ground to the Parishioners of the Township to
claim anything more than the Dole which has been so long
paid.&nbsp; The 20 shillings are given away to 20 Poor Widows on
St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<h3>2.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Pedley&rsquo;s
Charity</span>.</h3>
<blockquote><p>James Pedley, otherwise Fletcher, by his Will
dated 20 May, 1728, after the death of his wife, gave to his
brother, Richard Pedley, alias Fletcher, his heirs and assigns,
those two Closes of Land called by the name Little Clothers,
lying in the Liberty of Willenhall, in the Parish of
Wolverhampton, on condition that his said brother should pay or
cause to be paid 30s. a year out of the rent of the said two
Closes of land, as follows; that is to say, to the Minister of
Willenhall 6s. 8d. a year to preach a sermon on New Year&rsquo;s
Day; and unto Poor Housekeepers 8s. in bread yearly, upon New
Year&rsquo;s Day, at the Chapel as the Chapelwardens should think
fit; and to the Chapelwardens for their trouble 4d.; and 13s.
yearly to one of the Chapelwardens and to the Overseer of the
Poor to be given in bread to such Poor Housekeepers as they

gave the Closes, paying the aforesaid 30s. yearly as above
directed to the right heir of the Pedleys for ever.</p>
<p>The premises charged with this annuity of 30s. are at present
the property of Mr. George Bailey, in right of his wife, to whom
they descended as heir to her brother, Charles Pedley, the
great-nephew of the testator.</p>
<p>The several payments of 6s. 8d. to the Minister and 8s. and
13s. for bread, appear to have been annually made; but the bread
having been distributed by the Pedley family themselves, or
persons deputed by them, without the intervention of the
Chapelwarden or Overseer, the fees of 2s. 4d. to these Officers
have been hitherto withheld, and are indeed unnoticed in a Will
of James Pedley, dated in 1792, whereby he devises the Closes in
question to the above-named Charles Pedley, describing them as
subject to the other payments of 27s. 8d. only.</p>
<p>Mr. Bailey has, however, expressed his readiness to supply the
omission in future, and to pay the bread money, or deliver the
bread to the Officers of the Township to be distributed by them
according to the directions of the donor.</p>
<p>The distributions appear to have been hitherto made
respectively on New Year&rsquo;s Day and at Midsummer, among Poor
Old Widows and other Poor of the Township.</p>

Overseers of the Poor of the liberty of Willenhall, and of
certain others, being three of the principal Inhabitants of
Willenhall, on behalf of themselves and others, the inhabitants
of Willenhall, by the hands of the Steward, according to the

<blockquote><p>This Charity consists of the sum of &pound;5,
which appears to have been left by John Bate some time before the

of Willenhall on St. Thomas&rsquo;s Day.</p>
<p>The principal was placed at interest on 21 December, 1701, in
the hands of Joseph Hincks, on the security of his bond; and the
interest appears to have been duly paid by himself and his heirs
successively.&nbsp; It is now paid by Thomas Hincks on St.
Thomas&rsquo;s Day annually to fifteen Poor Widows of the
Township in shares of 4d. each.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The founders of the &ldquo;lost&rdquo; Prestwood Charity were
doubtless members of the family mentioned in Chapter VII. as
resident in Willenhall as early as 1409; Prestwood, be it noted,
was also the name of an ancient moated farm and homestead in
Wednesfield.&nbsp; The name of Prestwood is again mentioned, as
are also the names of the other Willenhall benefactors, Bates and
Tomkiss, in the endowment deeds of 1607, quoted in Chapter
XXI.&nbsp; As to the <!-- page 133--><a name="page133"></a><span

Willenhall stood in the location known as Welch End.</p>
<p>Concerning Pedley&rsquo;s Charity, which has not been
distributed these 50 years, the Churchwardens have, as recently
as 1895, made earnest attempts at its recovery.&nbsp; The lands
once chargeable for the dole were identified as Shares Acres,
lying between the canal and the road leading to New Invention
from Monmer Lane.&nbsp; The property, however, was found to be in
the hands of the Trustees of the late W. E. Jones; and as,
through the remissness of someone, the estate had been sold and
conveyed without due provision for the payment of the annuity
once charged upon it, the Trustees had not power to make such
payment.&nbsp; While the minerals under this land have been
yielding wealth, the Poor have been defrauded from their rightful
share in the same.</p>
<p>Painstaking inquiries for the other &ldquo;lost
charities&rdquo; have also been made, but with no success.&nbsp;
For many years the Incumbent and Wardens have provided and
distributed a Dole of 40 loaves, for which there has been no
legal responsibility resting upon them.</p>
<p>In 1881 Jeremiah Hartill gave &pound;200 to the Vicar and
Wardens, which was invested in Consols, and the interest is
annually distributed on January 1st amongst twenty poor people of
the township.&nbsp; The Hartill Charity and the Tomkys and Welch
Doles are the only ones now administered.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Thirty or more years ago a Mr. Stokes gave the Incumbent of
Willenhall &pound;500 to be applied in his absolute discretion
for the benefit of St. Giles&rsquo;s School.&nbsp; The interest
until recently was applied by him for that purpose.&nbsp; The
principal has recently been spent in purchase of an extended
playground for the new Infant Schools, and in the part purchase
of a site for a new Mixed Department, adjacent thereto.</p>
<p>A few years after the passing of Sir Robert Peel&rsquo;s Act
of 1847, advantage was taken of it to split the populous area of
the ancient chapelry into new district parishes; and by 1855 the
said chapelry was divided into three nearly equal parts, the new
parishes of St. Stephen and Holy Trinity, leaving to St.
Giles&rsquo;s Church <!-- page 134--><a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>Bentley and the remaining portion of
the Willenhall township.&nbsp; The fourth daughter parish, St.
Anne&rsquo;s, came a few years later.</p>
<p>St Stephen&rsquo;s Church, in Wolverhampton Street, was
erected mainly through the exertions of its first vicar, the Rev.
T. W. Fletcher, M.A., and opened in 1854, seven years after its
ecclesiastical district had been formed.&nbsp; Mr. Fletcher died
in 1890, and the living is now held by the Rev. Herbert Percy
Stevens, M.A.&nbsp; This parish maintains a Parochial Hall and
Mission at Portobello.</p>
<p>St. Anne&rsquo;s Church, Spring Bank, was built largely as a
memorial to his wife by Mr. H. Jeavon.&nbsp; It was consecrated
in 1861.</p>
<p>Holy Trinity Church (Short Heath) Vicarage and Schools were
all built by the Rev. Dr. Rosedale, the first vicar of the
parish, and father of the present vicar of St.
Giles&rsquo;s.&nbsp; His labours commenced in a Mission Room at
the Brown Jug Inn, Sandbeds, and he trained several very earnest
men for the ministry, including the Rev. John Bailey, first vicar
of the Pleck Church, Walsall, and the Rev. &mdash; Pritchard,
vicar of Blakenall Church, Bloxwich.&nbsp; The jubilee of the
building of the church was held about 1905.&nbsp; The Rev.
&mdash; Wood was the second vicar, the Rev. G. W. Johnson the
third, and the present vicar is the Rev. G. C. W. Pimbury.</p>
<p>A Mission Room at New Invention completes the list of Anglican
Establishments in Willenhall.</p>
<p>In connection with St. Giles&rsquo;s a Men&rsquo;s and a
Junior Men&rsquo;s Club have recently been established; and among
other projects for further developments in the parochial
machinery is a Mission Room at Shepwell Green.&nbsp; This
movement was initiated some years ago when the Rev. H. Edwards
was acting as Curate during the illness of the Rev. Mr. Fisher; a
site has recently been purchased, in the anticipation that the
Mission in due time will develop into a new ecclesiastical
parish.</p>
<p>Dr. Hartill, as Churchwarden, was instrumental in securing a
grant of &pound;700 from a bequest of &pound;15,000 left for
Church objects by a Miss Green, with which to increase the
endowment of Holy Trinity Church, Short Heath; this was
supplemented by another &pound;700 from the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners; while in the following year a further sum of
&pound;700 from each source was also obtained for increasing the
endowment of St. Anne&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<h2><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>XXIII.&mdash;The Fabric of the
Church.</h2>
<p>As already discovered (Chapter VII.), a church has existed in
Willenhall since the 13th century.&nbsp; It was at first a small
chapel-of-ease, and seems to have been dedicated in
pre-Reformation times to a non-biblical patron, Saint Giles.</p>
<p>The first edifice, as a mere chapel of accommodation, was in
all probability a very primitive structure, constructed entirely
of timber cut from the adjacent forest of Cannock.&nbsp; But when
it became a chantry also, the original structure may have been
replaced by a more elaborate edifice, in the style which is
generally known as half-timbered.</p>
<p>Soon after the Reformation the mother church of Wolverhampton
was pewed on a plan for the specifically allotted accommodation
of all the parishioners, when the centre aisle was given to the
inhabitants of Wolverhampton, the south aisle was set apart for
the people of Bilston, and the north aisle was appropriated to
Wednesfield and Willenhall.&nbsp; In those days, as previously
explained, the law supposed that every adult person attended
church on Sundays; there was, in fact, a penalty for absence
enforcible by law.</p>
<p>With regard to Willenhall&rsquo;s timber-constructed church,
there is evidence that in 1660 it was in a deplorable condition
through fire ravages.&nbsp; After the Reformation it became a
practice for collections to be made in the churches throughout
the country to provide funds for the repair or rebuilding of
parish churches which had fallen into a state of dilapidation
beyond the means of its own parishioners to make good; or for
other charitable purposes in which the needs of the one seemed to
call for the help of the many.&nbsp; These collections were
authorised to be made by Royal Letters Patent, through official
documents known as Briefs; and entries of these are to be found
in most Parish Registers till the middle of the 18th century,
when their frequency through the complaisance of the Court of
Chancery was considered such an abuse that it was ordered for the
future that their issue should be granted only after a formal
application to Quarter Sessions.&nbsp; Thus we find <!-- page
136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>records in the Tipton Registers of no less than seven
collections made there between 1657 and 1661 for the relief of
distress through fire and other causes in Desford, Southwold,
Drayton (Salop), Oxford, East Hogborne, Chichester, and Milton
Abbey.</p>
<p>Willenhall called for this form of national assistance in
1660, as entries of a Brief on its behalf have been found as far
apart as Chatham, in Kent, and Woodborough, in Notts, and may
doubtless be traced in various parish registers up and down the
country.&nbsp; Here is a copy of the Nottinghamshire
entry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">September ye 23,

<p>[It has been romantically suggested by a local writer that the
&ldquo;burning of Willenhall&rdquo; was an act of revenge
perpetrated by the Puritans of Lichfield and the vicinity for the
succour given at Bentley Hall in 1651 to the fugitive Charles
II.; and that these church collections are evidence of the
personal interest taken by that monarch on his Restoration, in
the place which had afforded him shelter in his hour of direst
need.&nbsp; Two considerations will immediately dispel any such
illusion.&nbsp; First, the Briefs were very commonplace affairs,
as already shown; secondly, displays of Stuart gratitude were
just as rare.&nbsp; All the reward commonplace affairs, as
already shown; secondly, displays of Stuart gratitude were just
as rare.&nbsp; All the reward Charles vouchsafed to the devoted
Lanes was the cheap honour of an augmentation of the family arms,
and the scanty gift of &pound;1,000 to Jane Lane.&nbsp; Allusion
has been made (Chapter XIII.) to the Royal fugitive taking
advantage of the hiding-place afford by the &ldquo;priest&rsquo;s
hole&rdquo; at Moseley Hall where Charles was loyally <!-- page
137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>secreted by Jesuitic and other priestly adherents,
though they might have pocketed a reward of &pound;10,000 by
betraying him&mdash;yet in after years this ungrateful prince had
no compunction in signing more than twenty death warrants against
Romanist priests, merely for the crime of being priests!]</p>

<p>To resume our history of Willenhall Church: What was
manifestly a &ldquo;restored&rdquo; chapel was in 1727
consecrated by Edward, Lord Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, on
the same day that Bilston Chapel was consecrated; but the
building could have been scarcely worth the attempt, as twenty
years later it had to be entirely replaced.</p>
<p>On August 14th of the year 1727, the Bishop having first
consecrated Bilston Chapel, in the presence of a large assembly
of the local clergy, which included the Rev. R. Ames and two
other prebendaries; the vicars of Walsall and Dudley; Mr. Tyrer,
curate of Tettenhall; Mr. Gibbons, minister of Codsall; Mr.
Varden, rector of Darlaston; Mr. Perry, curate of Wednesbury; and
Mr. Holbrooke, curate of Willenhall; his lordship proceeded to
Willenhall in a coach and four, where the ceremony of
Consecration &ldquo;in Latine&rdquo; was repeated upon what was
merely a renovated building.&nbsp; After which Squire Lane, of
Bentley, gave a splendid entertainment in celebration of the
event.</p>
<p>A &ldquo;chappel-yard for the Burial of the Dead,&rdquo; which
had been added, was consecrated at the same time, and, strangely
enough&mdash;as if the parishioners of Willenhall were eager to
signalise their acquisition of such a parochial institution as a
graveyard&mdash;the first interment was made the selfsame
day.</p>
<p>About the middle of the eighteenth century there was a wave of
zeal for church extension, on which we find Wolverhampton carried
along rather freely; for within the short space of ten years,
under the auspices of Dr. Pennistan Booth, the enterprising Dean,
the building of four chapels-of-ease was projected.&nbsp; These
daughter churches were:&mdash;</p>
<p>1746&mdash;Wednesfield (Advowson of which was vested in Walter
Gough and his heirs).</p>
<p>1748&mdash;Willenhall.</p>
<p><!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>1753&mdash;Bilston.</p>
<p>1755&mdash;St. John&rsquo;s (the new building was injured by
fire, and not consecrated till 1760).</p>
<p>From the Registers is gleaned the following issue of a writ to
release sequestration of fees:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Memorandum.&nbsp; March 4, 1748.&mdash;The Faculty
for Rebuilding and enlarging ye Chapel of Willenhall authorized
ye then present Ministr, ye Revd. Titus Neve to charge and
receive for Breaking up ye Ground or Building a Vault in ye said
Chapel ye sum of two Guineas and also one Guinea for opening ye
same at any time afterwards to him and his successors.&nbsp; The
Intention of this Siquise was to prevent frequent interments
which are a common annoyance to ye Living Votaries for whose use
ye Chapel was erected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the Diary of Dr. Richard Wilkes is extracted the
following illuminative entry&mdash;a contemporary record of the
state of the ancient edifice:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>May 6, 1748.&mdash;This day I set out the
foundation of a new church in this town; for the old one being
half timber, the sills, pillars, etc., were so decayed that the
inhabitants, when they met together, were in great danger of
being killed.&nbsp; It appeared to me, that the old church must
have been rebuilt, at least the middle aisle of it; and that the
first fabrick was greatly ornamented, and must have been the gift
of some rich man, or a number of such, the village then being but
thin of inhabitants, and, before the iron manufacture was begun
here, they could not have been able to erect such a fabrick; but
no date, or hint relating to it, was to be found; nor is anything
about it come to us by tradition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Willenhall&rsquo;s rebuilt church was completed in 1749, and
had a formal re-opening on October 30th of that year.&nbsp; An
entry in the Registers (which has already been quoted in Chapter
XVIII.) seems to intimate that the regular services were not
resumed till January 20th, 1750.</p>
<p>This edifice was a fair specimen of the crudities which went
to make up the &ldquo;churchwarden architecture&rdquo; of the
period; consisting <!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>mainly of a plain, box-like nave,
pierced on either side by half a dozen staring oblong windows,
and having in the whole of its hulk not one curved line or
rounded form by which relief could be afforded to the eye at any
single point.&nbsp; At one end of this unimposing structure was a
flattened scutiform excrescence which served as the chancel; from
the others rose the tower, the only feature by which the building
could be recognised as a church.&nbsp; The tower, not to put the
rest of the church out of countenance, was equally crude; its
window piercings being as debased in the Gothic style as was its
cornice in quasi-classical; and topped as it was by a low-pitched
hipped roof or squat pyramid, from the point of which rose high
into the air the famous Willenhall weathercock&mdash;the brazen
bird flaunting itself aloft, as if deriving its defiance from the
aggressive-looking furcated finials which surrounded it at the
four angles.</p>
<p>This church endured only for about a century, being replaced
in 1867 by the present edifice, erected at a cost of
&pound;7,000, raised by public subscription.&nbsp; The Chairman
of the Committee for the rebuilding was Mr. R. D. Gough, who,
with his wife, contributed &pound;1,700.&nbsp; Other large
contributors were Mrs. Stokes (with &pound;505), and the Vicar
and Trustees (who gave &pound;1,000).</p>
<p>St. Giles&rsquo;s Church is now a substantial stone building
in the Decorated style, consisting of nave, aisles, chancel and
transepts, and having at the west end a lofty square tower,
terminated with a pinnacle at each angle.&nbsp; The new fane was
soon adorned by the insertion of a number of stained glass
windows; the large east window was presented by Mr. R. D. Gough;
others were given by the Lords of the Manor of Stow Heath
(emblazoning the arms of Leveson-Gower and Giffard); by the Earl
of Lichfield and the Rev. Charles Lane (also heraldically
distinguished); one was put in as a memorial to members of the
Clemson family; and another to commemorate Mrs. Anwell, a
connection of the Gough family.</p>
<p>The work of enlarging the church was undertaken in 1897 in
memory of the late Incumbent, Mr. Fisher; and a fine organ was
installed in celebration of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s Diamond
Jubilee.&nbsp; Also at the same time choir stalls were
introduced, the choristers being <!-- page 140--><a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>brought
from the gallery, which latter feature was rightly removed
altogether.&nbsp; Among the improvements promoted by the
Incumbent and his energetic churchwardens, Dr. John T. Hartill
and Mr. H. H. Walker, of Bentley Hall, were the enlargement of
the churchyard and the scheme for providing a church house.</p>
<p>As the new incumbent, Mr. Rosedale, was a nephew of Mrs.
Gough, the generous contributor to the rebuilding fund of
1865&ndash;7, just mentioned, it was suggested that the house she
occupied might fittingly be transformed to serve as a
Parsonage.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Almost from the time pews were first put into churches, seats
became appurtenant to certain family mansions, and by custom
descended from ancestor to heir, without any ecclesiastical
concurrence.&nbsp; Instances of such proprietary pews having been
bequeathed by will have occurred in Willenhall within
comparatively recent times.&nbsp; Here is an extract from the
will of Thomas Hartill, dated June 5th, 1777:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I give and bequeath to my Son, Abraham Hartill,

<p>Similar testamentary disposals appear in the will of Isaac
Hartill, dated 27 May, 1818:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I give and devise to my Son, Isaac Hartill, all

</blockquote>
<p>Of like purport is the following extract from codicil to the
will of Samuel Hartill, dated June 9, 1821; probate Nov. 12,
1821:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>I give devise and bequeath to my nephew Henry

in the Wednesbury Circuit,&rdquo; by the Rev. W. J. Wilkinson,
published by J. M. Price, Darlaston, 1895; and for ampler detail
to &ldquo;Religious Wednesbury,&rdquo; by the present writer,
1900.</p>
<p>That the evangelical missioning of John Wesley was peculiarly
suited to the religious and social needs of the eighteenth
century, and nowhere more so than among the proletariat of the
mining and manufacturing Midlands, is now a generally accepted
truism.&nbsp; There is no direct evidence that the great
evangelist himself ever preached in Willenhall, but the
appearance on the scene of some of the earliest Methodist
preachers may be taken for granted.&nbsp; For were not the
prevailing sins of cockfighting and bull-baiting, and all the
other popular brutalities of the period, to be combated in
Willenhall as much as in Darlaston or Wednesbury?&nbsp; And where
the harvest was, were not the reapers always forthcoming?</p>
<p>According to Mr. A. Camden Pratt, in his &ldquo;Black Country
Methodism,&rdquo; the earliest Methodist services were open-air
meetings held round a big boulder at the corner of Monmore
Lane.&nbsp; Then the nucleus of a Willenhall congregation was
formed at a cottage in Ten House Row; outgrowing its
accommodation here, a removal was next made to a farmhouse with a
commodious kitchen at Hill End.</p>
<p>The leaders and preachers came from Darlaston, and it was not
till 1830 that Willenhall was favoured with a resident
&ldquo;travelling preacher,&rdquo; and the provision of a
Wesleyan Chapel&mdash;it was on the site of the present Wesleyan
Day Schools.&nbsp; The cause flourished <!-- page 144--><a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>and grew
mightily; chapels were established at Short Heath and Portobello,
on the Walsall Road (1865), and on Spring Bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Pratt pays a high tribute to the efforts of the Tildesleys
and the Harpers, but with a sense of justice he does not forget
the mead of gratitude always due to those early pioneers from
Darlaston, placing on the same bright scroll of fame the names of
Foster, Wilkes, Rubery, Silcock, Bowen, and Banks.</p>
<p>In the earlier history of local Wesleyanism, one of its chief
supporters was James Carpenter, founder of the existing firm of
Carpenter and Tildesley.&nbsp; Another pillar of Wesleyanism was
Jonah Tildesley, followed later in the good work by his two sons,
Josiah and Jesse, his grandson Thomas, George Ley Pearce, and
Isaac Pedley; and in a lesser degree by James Tildesley (who
married Harriet Carpenter), and the late John Harper, founder of
the Albion Works, now the largest place of employment in the
town.</p>
<p>One outcome of the Wesleyan spirit was seen about the year
1820, when James Carpenter, George Pearce, William Whitehouse,
and other leading inhabitants made a determined effort to put
down some of the coarser sports by which the annual Wake was
celebrated.&nbsp; Through their instrumentality many of the
ringleaders in the brutal sports were summoned and brought to
justice.&nbsp; The reformers dared to go even further&mdash;they
lodged a complaint with the bishop of the diocese against
&ldquo;Parson Moreton&rdquo; for encouraging these barbarous
pastimes among the people.&nbsp; The bishop, however, professed
that he was powerless to deal with the delinquent, owing to the
exceptional manner in which he was appointed to the living.&nbsp;
But the parson on his part was very wroth, and from his pulpit he
solemnly forbade any one of the name of Carpenter, Pearce, or
Whitehouse ever to enter the portals of Willenhall Church.</p>
<p>It cannot be said the injunction was enforced; but it is a
fact that from that time many church-goers were driven into the
Methodist fold.</p>
<p>The romantic side of the evangelisation of the Black Country
has been idealised by Mr. J. C. Tildesley in his &ldquo;Sketches
of <!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>Early Methodism,&rdquo; a series of short stories
founded on fact, and giving most graphic pictures of the moral
and social condition of the neighbourhood at that time.&nbsp;
This little volume may be regarded almost as one of the classics
of the Wesleyan Book Room.</p>
<p>A short history of local Methodism, it may be mentioned, was
deposited in the memorial stones of Wednesfield Chapel in
1885.</p>
<p>The existing Wesleyan Chapels, now under the direction of the
Rev. A. Hann and the Rev. Walter Fytche, are five in number,
namely, Union Street, Walsall Road, Monmer Lane, Short Heath, and
High Street, Portobello.&nbsp; Though the denomination may be as
strong as ever numerically, it can scarcely hope to rival its
old-time membership in verve and vigour.&nbsp; In England
fighting days never fail to produce fighting men.</p>
<p>Primitive Methodism first established itself at Monmer Lane,
and then removed to Little London, but did not meet with much
success at the outset, though it has now four flourishing chapels
in the township.&nbsp; They are all at present under the
direction of the Rev. C. L. Tack, and situated respectively at
New Invention, Spring Bank, Lane Head, and Russell Street.</p>
<p>Nonconformity was first brought into Willenhall from Coseley,
the brethren of the famous Darkhouse Chapel establishing a colony
at Little London, where eventually they erected a pioneer Baptist
Chapel.&nbsp; Of this chapel the Rev. A. Tettmar is now in
charge; a second chapel in Upper Lichfield Street, at which the
Rev. D. L. Lawrence ministers, and a third Baptist Chapel in New
Road testify to the growth of the denomination in
Willenhall.&nbsp; At one time the Baptists had day schools in the
town.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholics first made their appearance in modern
Willenhall some sixty years ago, when they established a small
mission at the bottom of Union Street, afterwards building their
resent chapel, which is dedicated to St. Mary, and of which the
Rev. Walter Poulton (in succession to the Rev. W. P. Wells) is
priest.</p>
<p>A mission of the Catholic Apostolic Brethren, served from
Wolverhampton, completes the list of religious agencies now at
work in Willenhall.</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>In the religious and social history of the place
mention cannot be omitted of some few names which have earned the
respect of the townspeople.&nbsp; Among them, James Tildesley, a
large employer of labour, whose amiability, and kindness of heart
exemplified that patriarchal relationship which once existed
between master and men, anterior to the days of modern limited
liability companies; George Ley Pearce, a Wesleyan of marked
personality, and an eminently good man, whose memorial in the old
Cemetery is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">ERECTED<br />
by voluntary subscription in memory of<br />
GEORGE LEY PEARCE<br />
(of Willenhall),<br />
who died December 31st, 1873,<br />
Aged 78;<br />
And was buried in the adjacent vault.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: center">For fifty years he zealously
devoted himself to the work of visiting the sick and afflicted of
this town, whether rich or poor, and was made a great blessing to
many.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">His work was the outward expression
of that Christ-like charity which pervaded his soul.</p>
<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The opportunity to do good to our fellowmen comes to all,
irrespective of sect or sex.&nbsp; One to embrace it with
goodwill was Edith Florence Hartill, daughter of William Henry
Hartill, who worked long and steadfastly in connection with the
Bible Reading Union, never relaxing her efforts for the uplifting
of the very poorest and most helpless of the community.</p>
<p>In the Market Place stands a public clock mounted upon a stone
pedestal, having a watering-trough for cattle at its base.&nbsp;
This was erected, as an inscription upon it testifies, as a
memorial to the late Joseph Tonks, surgeon, &ldquo;whose generous
and unsparing devotion in the cause of alleviating human
suffering&rdquo; was &ldquo;deemed worthy of public
record.&rdquo;&nbsp; The memorialised, Mr. Joseph Tonks,
M.R.C.S.E., L.A.H., was a native of the town, being a son of Mr.
<!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Silas Tonks, of the Forge Inn, Spring Bank.&nbsp; He
began to practise in Willenhall about 1879, and soon made himself
extremely popular among the working classes, and particularly
with the Friendly Societies, who initiated the movement to
provide this public memorial.</p>
<p>Without sorting into sects and creeds, let it be acknowledged
that Willenhall has been fortunate in the number of its townsmen
whose lives have been usefully and commendably spent in the
public service and for the public good.&nbsp; Among those whose
influence on the social and moral well-being of the place has not
been without appreciable benefit, may be named Joseph Carpenter
Tildesley, R. D. Gough, Josiah Tildesley, Clement Tildesley,
Jesse Tildesley, Isaac Pedley, Henry Hall, Thomas Kidson, Henry
Vaughan, W. E. Parkes, and J. H. James.&nbsp; Other appreciations
will occur in our concluding chapters, as the names more
fittingly happen under the topics yet to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Having brought to a conclusion Willenhall&rsquo;s
ecclesiastical and religious history&mdash;and the largeness with
which the church bulked on the lives of the people in past times
must be held accountable for the lengthiness of this
portion&mdash;we may now turn to the further consideration of its
civil, social, and industrial history.</p>

<h2><!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>XXV.&mdash;Manorial Government.</h2>
<p>Willenhall is a township of some 1,980 acres in extent, carved
out of the ancient parish of Wolverhampton, and situated midway
between that town and the town of Walsall, being about three
miles distant from either.&nbsp; Strangely enough, Willenhall is
included in the Hundred of Offlow, although Wolverhampton, of
which it once formed a part, is in Seisdon Hundred.&nbsp;
Willenhall has never been a civil parish (as previously
explained), nor has it been a market town; the small open market
held in its streets each week-end having grown up by
prescription, but never legally established by grant of
charter.</p>
<p>The place grew up as a hamlet on the banks of a little stream,
just on the verge of Cannock Forest.&nbsp; As a village community
it seems to have been subject, so soon as its outer limits had
been defined, to three territorial lords.&nbsp; Reference to
Chapter VI. will disclose that at Domesday (1086) three hides of
land in Willenhall belonged to the king, and were part of the
royal manor of Stowheath; two hides were the property of the
Church of Wolverhampton, and constituted the prebendal manor of
Willenhall; and a century or two later, the manor of Bentley,
evidently carved out of the royal forest of Cannock, became
included within this township.</p>
<p>Of <span class="smcap">Stowheath Manor</span>, the portions
lying within Willenhall are a small part of the modern township,
together with Short Heath, New Invention, Lanehead, Sandbeds,
Little London, and Portobello.&nbsp; The remainder of this manor
stretches beyond the Willenhall boundary into Bilston and
Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>To a manor or lordship was usually attached a Court Baron, or
domestic court of the lord, for the settling of disputes relating
to property among the tenants, and for redressing misdemeanours
and nuisances arising within the manor.&nbsp; The business was
transacted by a jury or homage elected by and from the
tenants.</p>
<p>How far the customary officers were chosen every year by the
Willenhall Court Baron cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp; Doubtless
<!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>appointments were made from time to time of such
manorial tears as Hedgers and Ditchers, to look after the
highways and byways, a Common Pinner to impound stray cattle, and
Head boroughs or Petty Constables &ldquo;to apprehend all vagrom
men&rdquo; whose room was esteemed more highly than their
company.</p>
<p>The present lords of the Manor of Stowheath are the Duke of
Sutherland, and W. T. C. Giffard, Esq., of Chillington; the
Steward of the Manor is Mr. W. E. Stamer, of Lilleshall; and the
Deputy-Steward Mr. Frederick T. Langley, of Wolverhampton.&nbsp;
The Court Bailiff is Mr. H. G. Duncalfe, of Wolverhampton, but
none of the ancient customary officers are now elected; and as
most of the copyholds have been enfranchised, no Court Baron for
Stowheath has been held in Willenhall since 22nd December, 1865;
till then it had taken place annually for many years at the house
of Mr. George Baker, the Neptune Inn.&nbsp; Subsequently this
manorial court was held at the Bank, Cock Street, Wolverhampton,
and now more privately at the offices of the Deputy-Steward, in
that town, which was anciently within the jurisdiction of two
manors, Stowheath and Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>THE <span class="smcap">Manor of Willenhall</span>, which,
though prebendal, is impropriate, comprises the rest of the
township; of this manor the Baron Barnard is the present lord,
and the sole recipient of all tithes from Willenhall, Short
Heath, and Wednesfield.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the medi&aelig;val village of Willenhall was
obtained in Chapters VIII. and XI.; it is clear the prebendal
manor remained always a taxable area for the mere production of
tithes, and it was the royal manor of Stowheath, when it had
passed into the hands of a subject, which developed into the
community in the midst of which the &ldquo;mansum
capitale,&rdquo; or manor house, was erected.</p>
<p>By whom or when a manor house was first set up in Willenhall
is not known; but it is not improbable that the lordship of
Stowheath, soon after it passed out of the hands of the King, was
acquired by a Leveson, who seated himself on the estate,
reserving to himself the portion which lay nearest his mansion
(demesne <!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>lands), and distributing the rest
among his tenants (tenemental lands).</p>
<p>The house in which the Levesons resided, as previously
recorded, was situated on the east side of Stafford Street; the
Midland Railway now runs through the site, but before the line
was cut, and whilst the mines remained ungotten, traces of its
ancient moat were clearly discernible.</p>
<p>The residence now known as the Manor House, and occupied by Dr
J. T. Hartill, though it has no connection with the manorial
mansion of the Leveson family, is not without some association
with the manorial form of government.&nbsp; It appears that
upwards of half a century ago, when the late Jeremiah Hartill
(uncle of the present occupant of the house) was taking his full
share in the public life of Willenhall, it was most difficult, if
not next to impossible, to get copyhold land in this manor
enfranchised.</p>
<p>At that time there was a very considerable amount of property
in Willenhall held by this old-world tenure, and this induced Mr.
Jeremiah Hartill to take a very prominent part in the local
efforts which were then being made to introduce the principle of
compulsory enfranchisement.&nbsp; As the result of a national
movement in this direction an Act was passed in 1841 to provide a
statutory method of enfranchisement; and the matter was carried
still further in 1852 by another Act, which introduced the
principle of compulsory enfranchisement.</p>
<p>Mr. Hartill had at that time recently built himself a new
house (1847), when, as the local leader in a movement which had
been brought so far on the road to success, he was invited to a
public dinner in recognition of his public-spirited
efforts.&nbsp; One of the speakers at the banquet, in proposing
the health of the guest of the evening, suggested that as Mr.
Jeremiah Hartill had fought so successfully in helping to
overcome the opposition of the Lords of the Manor to this measure
of land reform, his new house might not inappropriately be dubbed
the Manor House.&nbsp; The suggestion was heartily (no pun
intended) approved by all present, and by that name the house has
ever since been known.</p>
<p><!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>The names of the chief residents in Willenhall in 1327
may be gleaned from the Subsidy Roll given in Chapter IX.; very
similar names occur in another list of the taxpayers to the
Scotch War of 1333.&nbsp; Some few held land under certain
specified rents and free services, and from these came the
earliest freeholders; many more held by the baser tenure of the
lord&rsquo;s will, and having nothing to show except the copy of
the rolls made by the Steward of the Lord&rsquo;s Court, were
known as copyholders.</p>
<p>The vast importance of these Court Rolls may be gathered from
Chapter XXI.&nbsp; The Court Rolls of the Manor of Stowheath now
in existence commence on 4 January, 1645; but in the chapter
referred to mention of a &ldquo;Leete&rdquo; being held in
Wolverhampton much earlier will be found.</p>
<p>The residue of the Manor being uncultivated, was termed the
lord&rsquo;s waste, and served for public roads, and for common
or pasture to both the lord and his tenants.&nbsp; Reference to
the enclosure of the last remnants of the &ldquo;waste&rdquo; was
quoted in the Report of 1825 on the Tomkys and Welch Charities
(Chapter XXII.).</p>
<p>There were two kinds of enclosures, however, all made in the
last few centuries; the enclosure of the open commons or wastes,
and the enclosure of the common fields.&nbsp; &ldquo;Willenhall
Field,&rdquo; mentioned in the &ldquo;Report on Prestwood&rsquo;s
Dole,&rdquo; as lying along the highway towards Darlaston, was
arable land, not pasture.&nbsp; For anciently there was a common
field system in every parish, and &ldquo;Willenhall Field&rdquo;
was the area cultivated co-operatively by the whole of the
parishioners or group of individuals.</p>
<p>In 1377 the <span class="smcap">Manor of Bentley</span> was
held &ldquo;in capite,&rdquo; that is, direct from the King, by
one who called himself after his estate, William de
Bentley.&nbsp; He held it for rendering to Edward III. the feudal
service of &ldquo;Keeping&rdquo; the King&rsquo;s Hay of Bentley
within the royal Forest of Cannock&mdash;the Forest was then
divided into a number of &ldquo;hays&rdquo; or bailiwicks.&nbsp;
(See &ldquo;Chronicles of Cannock Chase,&rdquo; p. 14.)</p>
<p>The estate seems to have descended to him from his
grandfather, to whom it had been granted in the reign of Edward
II.; and it is noteworthy that his wife, Alianora, was a
Leveson.</p>
<p><!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>In 1421 William Griffiths established his right to
Bentley, and in 1430 it was conveyed to Richard Lone de la
Hide.&nbsp; Of the family of this Richard Lone of the Hyde there
were afterwards two branches; one, the Hamptons, of Stourton
Castle, and the other, the Lanes, of Bentley.</p>
<p>The halo of romance which grew up around Bentley Hall during
the seigniory of the Lanes is well known.&nbsp; It was the scene
of Charles II.&rsquo;s wonderful escape from the Roundheads,
under the protection of Jane Lane, whom he was afterwards wont to
call his &ldquo;Guardian Angel&rdquo;; it was the critical scene
of John Wesley&rsquo;s adventure in the hands of the Wednesbury
mob.&nbsp; The mansion has since been rebuilt.</p>
<p>The Lanes sold the Manor of Bentley in 1748 to Joseph Turton,
of Wolverhampton, and he in turn sold it to the first Lord Anson,
ancestor of the present holder.</p>
<p>The Manor comprises 1,200 acres, none of which is now
copyhold.&nbsp; There was formerly a Court Leet jurisdiction, but
everything connected with ancient manorial government has
disappeared.&nbsp; The Earl of Lichfield is sole owner, except
for a few acres belonging to the church, and the portions which
have been acquired by the local authority for the Cemetery and
the Sewerage Works.</p>
<p>Bentley is a parish without a church, or a chapel, and until
the Willenhall District Council recently made a Cemetery there,
it was also without a burial ground.</p>
<p>Bentley has but a scant population, and contains not a single
inn.&nbsp; Its living history seems to have centred almost
entirely round the old family mansion of the Lanes.</p>
<p>In 1660 a tax was levied on the fire-hearth of every
dwelling-house, and the amount collected under this grievous
impost in Willenhall was returned as &pound;9 14s. 3d.,
representing 97 hearths.&nbsp; These figures seem to indicate
that in the reign of Charles II. the population of the place,
including the large hall at Bentley, could not have exceeded
500.</p>
<h2><!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>XXVI.&mdash;Modern
Self-Government.</h2>
<p>For centuries the Manorial and the Parochial forms of
government ran together side by side in this country, till these
two antiquated ideas of feudal lordship and church temporalities
had to give way before the growing democratic principle of
elective representation, and they were eventually supplanted by
the modern methods of popular self-government.</p>
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth&mdash;say, half a century after the
suppression of the monasteries which had hitherto succoured the
poor&mdash;we get the first of our Poor Laws, accompanied by the
rise of the Overseer, and by much added importance to the office
of Churchwarden, or, as he was called in Willenhall, the
Chapel-warden.&nbsp; The establishment of Church doles goes a
long way to explain how strenuously the community strove to evade
its liability to the poor, and it is probable that Willenhall did
not establish its small workhouse till the eighteenth
century.&nbsp; This was superseded when the Wolverhampton Union
was constituted in 1834.</p>
<p>In 1776 the sum of &pound;294 14s. 3d. had to be collected for
poor rates in Willenhall, a sum which by 1785 had grown to
&pound;548 14s. 2d., and which for some years later averaged
upwards of &pound;500.</p>
<p>The Vestry, or public assembly of parishioners, would
supplement these feeble efforts at local government by choosing
not only Chapelwardens, but Parish Constables and the
Waywardens.&nbsp; The custody of the stocks was entrusted to the
former, while the latter were supposed to superintend the amateur
efforts of the parishioners to repair their own highways, every
one being then liable to furnish either manual labour or team
work for this laudable public purpose.</p>
<p>Publicly elected and unsalaried Waywardens were naturally but
feeble instruments to work with; so in the early nineteenth
century, when coaching was at its zenith, this antiquated and
ineffective system was superseded in Willenhall, as in many other
places, by an elected Highway Board, charged with the duty of
<!-- page 154--><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>looking after all highways and common streets, ancient
bridges, ditches, and watercourses.&nbsp; In a dilettante sort of
way this Board was also a sanitary body.</p>
<p>In 1734 Willenhall is recorded to have suffered from a plague
called the &ldquo;Bloody flux,&rdquo; which carried away its
victims in a very few hours after the seizure.&nbsp; It is stated
in the Parish Registers that there were buried in this year 82
persons, which was 67 in excess of the previous year.&nbsp; The
population then was under 1,000.</p>
<p>Cholera and other epidemic scourges having made it apparent
that beyond preserving the peace and mending the roads, the
paramount duty of local self-government was to protect the
people&rsquo;s health, Willenhall in 1854 showed itself alive to
this fact by adopting the new Public Health Acts and calling into
being its first Local Board.</p>
<p>Nothing can convey an idea of the material blessings which
resulted from this better than a glance at the vital statistics
relating to Willenhall.&nbsp; The death-rate per

<p>It was not till 1866, however, that the Board appointed its
first medical officer of health, Dr. Parke.&nbsp; He was shortly
afterwards succeeded by Mr. William Henry Hartill, and upon his
death, in 1888, the present medical officer of heath, Dr. J. T.
Hartill, was appointed.&nbsp; The chief executive officers in
succession have been Mr. E. Wilcox (who was not a solicitor), Mr.
John Clark, and the present clerk, Mr. Rowland Tildesley,
appointed in 1894.</p>
<p>In the meantime the population, particularly in the newer
outlying districts, had been growing rapidly.&nbsp; The
population of Willenhall at the first national census in 1801 was
only 3,143, and the growth in the early decades was slow, as
these figures disclose:</p>

<p>With the growth thus becoming so rapid, it was thought
desirable, in 1872, to erect Short Heath into a separate Sanitary
Authority.&nbsp; The area allotted to the Short Heath Board of
Health was that north of the Birmingham Canal, but the village of
Short Heath itself remained part of the Township of
Willenhall.</p>

<p>After the passing of Sir H. H. Fowler&rsquo;s Local Government
Act in 1895, both authorities became Urban District
Councils.&nbsp; Short Heath then as a separate township had its
area extended to take in Short Heath village, with New Invention,
Lanehead, Sandbeds, Lucknow, Fibbersley, in addition to the
former Local Board district, together with a slice from the old
Wednesfield Local Board district added on its Essington side.</p>
<p>No part of what used to be called Stow Heath was in Willenhall
Township, the extreme western boundary of the latter being Stow
Heath Lane.</p>
<p>Modern Willenhall, although without public parks or pleasure
grounds, and not yet possessing public baths, is fairly well
equipped for its size and rateable value.&nbsp; It has its Public
Offices, but no Town Hall; it has a Free Library, established in
1875, and a full complement of efficient primary schools.&nbsp;
In 1877 it established its own School Board under the Act of
1870, but under the later Act of 1902 its educational affairs
became vested in the Staffordshire County Council.</p>
<p><!-- page 156--><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Heath; and Willenhall is now supplied by the Willenhall Gas
Company, the present system of public street lighting being that
of the very efficient incandescent burner.</p>
<p>The Sewerage of the town was completed in 1890.&nbsp; There
are two public cemeteries; the Old Cemetery provided about 1851
under the Burial Acts, and the newer one at Bentley, established
under the Act of 1879.</p>
<p>The Police are, as in most townships, under the control of the
Staffordshire County Council; and Petty Sessions are held once a
week (on Mondays).&nbsp; Seventy years ago Willenhall had a Court
of Requests for the recovery of debts up to &pound;5.</p>
<p>For Parliamentary representation Willenhall formed a portion
of Staffordshire till the great Reform Bill of 1832 made
Wolverhampton a borough, when it became part of that more
important urban constituency.</p>
<p>For communication with the outer world Willenhall has had the
advantage of the London and North-Western Railway from the
earliest possible time&mdash;since the &ldquo;Grand Junction
Railway&rdquo; (commenced in 1835) was opened to public traffic
on July 4th, 1837.&nbsp; Great were the rejoicings, and
prodigious the wonderment when the first train passed through on
that memorable day.&nbsp; Since the later decades of the last
century the Midland Railway has also tapped Willenhall.</p>
<p>The town is equally well supplied with tramways; the
Wolverhampton District Electric Tramways, Limited, controlling
three lines, to Wolverhampton, to Bilston, and Darlaston
respectively; while the Walsall Corporation afford facilities for
communication with their thriving and go-ahead borough.&nbsp; It
is worthy of note that the old-fashioned carrier&rsquo;s cart is
not obsolete in Willenhall; this is probably because its staple
industries provide so many small <!-- page 157--><a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>parcels for
transmission to Wolverhampton, Birmingham, and other centres not
too far distant.</p>
<p>The Wyrley and Essington Canal for heavy traffic was made in
1792, and is still a useful highway, particularly to the Cannock
Chase Collieries.</p>

<h2><!-- page 158--><a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>XXVII.&mdash;The Town of Locks and
Keys.</h2>
<p>Willenhall is &ldquo;the town of locks and keys&rdquo;; its
staple industry has been described in such graceful and
felicitous terms by Elihu Burritt (see his &ldquo;Walks in the
Black Country,&rdquo; pp. 206&ndash;214, written in 1868) that
the present writer at once confesses the inadequacy of his poor
pen to say anything new on the subject, engaging as it is.</p>
<p>The great American writer, be it noted, does not fail at the
very outset to pay a well-deserved tribute to James Carpenter
Tildesley, as the foremost authority on the subject, and
compliments him on the versatility displayed in his article on
Locks and Keys, contributed to that co-operative literary work,
&ldquo;Birmingham and the Midland Hardware District,&rdquo; which
was specially issued for the British Association meeting at
Birmingham in 1865.</p>
<p>The lockmakers of antiquity worked in wood and not in metal, a
key consisting of hard wood pegs being made to turn in a wooden
lock of loose pegs.&nbsp; The Romans first introduced the iron
key with wards instead of pegs.</p>
<p>The subject is full of interest; for lock-making is among the
most ancient of the mechanical crafts, and has for centuries
afforded a wide and ample scope as one of the branches of
industrial art.&nbsp; As in many other industrial crafts the
religious enthusiasm of the Middle Ages impelled the
artist-mechanic to throw his whole soul into the manipulation and
adornment of his keys, key-hole escutcheons, and other parts of
door-fastening furniture.&nbsp; With his steel pencil and
gravers, his chisels and his drills, the craftsman of olden times
produced an article of utility which was at the same time a work
of art.&nbsp; Will the Art Classes of modern Willenhall be able
to achieve as much for the staple industry of the town as did the
whole-souled enthusiasm of the Middle Ages?</p>
<p>The Gothic key, usually of iron or of bronze, was generally
plain; but after the Renaissance the best efforts of the
locksmiths&rsquo; art were directed to the decoration of the bow
and the shaft, and <!-- page 159--><a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>many finely wrought specimens of
ornamental old keys are still in existence.</p>
<p>On the utilitarian side of our subject, industrial history
records that we are indebted to the Chinese for unpickable locks
of the lever and tumbler principle; and to the Dutch for the
combination or letter-lock.&nbsp; The latter ingenious
contrivance contained four revolving rings, on which were
engraved the letters of the alphabet, and they had to be turned
in such a way as to spell some pre-arranged word of four letters,
as O P E N, or A M E N, before the lock could be opened.</p>
<p>Allusion to this complex contrivance is made by the poet Carew
in some verses written in the year 1620&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>As doth a lock<br />
That goes with letters&mdash;for till every one be known<br />
The lock&rsquo;s as fast as if you had found none.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mechanical ingenuity in lock making has also expanded itself
along the line of marvellous miniatures, in the production of toy
locks so small that they could be worn as pendants or personal
ornaments.&nbsp; Allusion will presently be made to a Willenhall
specimen.</p>
<p>Another ingenious variety of locks was contrived to grab and
hold the fingers of pilferers.</p>
<p>The first patent granted in England for a lock was in 1774;
ten years later Joseph Bramah, of London, &ldquo;the Napoleon of
locks,&rdquo; patented his famous production, with which he
challenged the whole world.&nbsp; The reward of 200 guineas which
he offered to anyone who could pick his lock remained unclaimed
for many years, till in the Exhibition year 1851 an American
visitor named Hobbs took up the challenge, and succeeded, after a
few days of persevering experiment, in overcoming the
inviolability of it.</p>
<p>The sensation caused by this achievement was almost of
national dimensions; but of more importance was the decided
impetus it have to the inventive skill of lock makers, by
demonstrating that Bramah had not yet arrived at finality in lock
making; a great number of further improvements were soon
forthcoming in the manufacture of these goods.</p>
<p><!-- page 160--><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>Chubb&rsquo;s patent was granted in 1818; this inventor
declared it was possible to have the locks on the doors of every
house in London opened by a different key, and yet have a
master-key that would pass the whole of them.&nbsp; Chubb&rsquo;s
world-famous concern is now located at Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>Dr. Plot, writing of this county in 1686, makes no mention of
the trade being carried on in Willenhall, but gives some account
of it in Wolverhampton; gossiping pleasantly on
&ldquo;sutes&rdquo; of six or more locks, passable by one
master-key, being sold round the country by the chapmen of his
time; of the finely wrought keys he had seen; of the curious
tell-tale locks which recorded the times they had been opened;
and of one valuable Wolverhampton specimen containing chimes
which could be set to &ldquo;go&rdquo; at any particular
hour.</p>
<p>A local writer has said&mdash;on what authority is not
stated&mdash;that Queen Elizabeth granted to the township of
Willenhall the privilege of making all the locks required for
State purposes; and argues from that profitable piece of State
patronage the rapid growth of Willenhall, as evidenced by the
fact that in 1660 when the Hearth Tax came to be levied this
place paid on 13 more hearths than the mother town of
Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>Dr. Wilkes has recorded that in his time Willenhall consisted
of one long street, newly paved; and he then proceeds to
say:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The village did not begin to flourish till
the iron manufactory was brought into these parts in the reign of
Queen Elizabeth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may, or may not, refer to the making of locks and keys,
but it certainly refers to the great devastation of Cannock
Forest in providing charcoal for iron-smelting.&nbsp; The doctor
continues:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Since that time this place is become very
populous, and more locks of all kinds are made here than in any
other town of the same size in England or Europe.&nbsp; The
better sort of which tradesmen have erected many good
houses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some of these &ldquo;good houses&rdquo; are still standing;
and as to the &ldquo;populousness&rdquo; of the place, there may
have been 2,000 inhabitants at that time.&nbsp; A return has been
given forth that in 1770 Willenhall contained 148 locksmiths,
Wolverhampton 134, <!-- page 161--><a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>and Bilston 8; while nearly a
century later, in 1855, the numbers were Willenhall 340,
Wolverhampton 110, and Bilston 2, which shows that the trade grew
in Willenhall at the expense of the adjoining places.&nbsp; Yet
lockmaking was carried on in Bilston as early as 1590, when the
Perrys, the Kempsons, and the Tomkyses, all leading families,
were engaged in the trade.&nbsp; In 1796 Isaac Mason, inventor of
the &ldquo;fly press&rdquo; for making various parts of a lock,
migrated from Bilston to Willenhall.</p>
<p>The Willenhall specimen of a miniature lock is thus mentioned
in a diary of the Rev. T. Unett, &ldquo;June 13, 1776, James
Lees, of Willenhall, aged 63 years and upwards, showed me a
padlock with its key, made by himself, that was not the weight of
a silver twopence.&nbsp; He at the same time shewed me a lock
that was not the weight of a silver penny; he was then making the
key to it, all of iron.&nbsp; He said he would be bound to make a
dozen locks, with their keys, that should not exceed the weight
of a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the rise of factories into which workmen might be
collected, and their labour more healthily regulated, Willenhall
lock-making was always conducted in small domiciliary
workshops.&nbsp; Had any one at the close of the eighteenth
century peeped in at the grimy little windows of one of these
low-roofed workshops, and made himself acquainted with the
extreme dirtiness of the calling, he would scarcely have ventured
to regard it as one befitting the dainty hands of the highest
personage of the most fastidious of nations.&nbsp; Yet that
unfortunate monarch, Louis XVI., prided himself not on his
statesmanship, but upon his skill as a practical locksmith, and
his intimacy with all the intricacies of the craft.&nbsp; He had
fitted up in his palace at the Tuileries a forge with hearth and
anvil, bellows and bench, from which it was his delight to turn
out with his own hands all kinds of work in the shape of
&ldquo;spring, double bolt, or catch lock.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>He smokes his forge, he bares his sinewy arm,<br
/>
And bravely pounds the sounding anvil warm.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Locks of every variety of principle and quality are produced
in Willenhall; the chief kinds being the cabinet lock, the best
qualities of which range from 10s. to &pound;3 each, while the
commoner <!-- page 162--><a name="page162"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 162</span>ones are sold at from 10s. to 3s.
the dozen; the rim lock for doors having two or three bolts, and
opening with knob and key; the stock or fine plate lock, imbedded
in a wooden case to stand the weather when used on exposed yard
or stable doors; the drawback lock for hill doors, with a spring
bolt that can be worked from the inside with a knob or from the
outside with a latch-key; the dead lock, having one large bolt
worked by the key, but not catching or springing like the rim
lock; the mortice lock, which is buried in the door, and may be
of the dead, the rim, or the drawback variety; the familiar loose
padlock made in immense quantities both of iron and of brass; and
others less familiar.</p>
<p>The lock-producing centre includes Wolverhampton, Willenhall,
Wednesfield, and some of the outlying rural districts like
Brewood and Pendeford, where parts and fittings are
prepared.&nbsp; In the mother parish the business is extensive
and extending; at Wednesfield, iron cabinets and till locks, as
well as various kinds of keys, are produced in great numbers, for
keys are frequently made apart from the locks as a separate
branch of the trade.</p>
<p>Willenhall produces most of the same kinds as Wolverhampton,
except the fine plate, though oftener in the cheaper qualities;
rim locks are very largely made, all on the Carpenter and Young
patent, most of them for export.&nbsp; Willenhall locks are all
warded, the wards varying in strength and complexity, known as
common, fine round, sash, and solid wards.</p>
<p>It was the Carpenter and Young invention of 1830, making the
action of the catch bolt perpendicular instead of horizontal,
which renewed the vitality of the town&rsquo;s staple
industry.</p>
<p>As registered the patent was entered:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No. 5,880, 18 January, 1830.&nbsp; James
Carpenter, of Willenhall, and John Young, of Wolverhampton,
locksmiths.&nbsp; Improvements in locks.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. R. B. Prosser, a recognised authority on patents and
inventions, records that in 1841 Carpenter brought an action
against one Smith, but the verdict was given for the defendant,
it being held that Carpenter&rsquo;s lock was not a new invention
(Webster&rsquo;s Reports of Patent Cases, Vol. I., p. 530).</p>
<p><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>Notwithstanding this the lock has always been known,
and is still known, as &ldquo;Carpenter&rsquo;s lift-up
lock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James Carpenter, the founder of the business still carried on
under the style of Carpenter and Tildesley, was not a native of
Willenhall.&nbsp; His first place of business was in Walsall
Street opposite the &ldquo;Wake Field&rdquo;; thence he removed
to Stafford Street, occupying the premises now the Three Crowns
Inn; subsequently building and occupying the Summerford Works
(and Summerford House) in the New Road, where the concern is
still carried on James Carpenter, the patentee, was a keen man of
business, and distinguished for great decision of
character.&nbsp; His daughter Harriet married James Tildesley,
who became a partner in the business.&nbsp; Carpenter died in
1844, and Tildesley in 1876, and the concern has since been
carried on by the two eldest sons of the latter in partnership,
James Carpenter Tildesley (who is now permanently invalided, and
of whom more anon), and Clement Tildesley.&nbsp; Mr. Clement
Tildesley, who, like his brother, is a county magistrate, still
lives at Summerford House, where he was born.</p>
<p>Mr. Rowland Tildesley, solicitor, and Clerk to the Willenhall
Urban District Council, is the fourth son of James Tildesley.</p>
<p>James Tildesley&rsquo;s eldest daughter, Louisa Elizabeth,
married William Henry Hartill, surgeon, and J.P. for the county
of Stafford, who died in 1889; his second daughter, Emily,
married John Thomas Hartill, J.P., surgeon, who filled the office
of President of the Staffordshire Branch of the British Medical
Association in 1885, and again in 1907.</p>
<p>With these few biographical details of Willenhall&rsquo;s
chief inventor we pass on.</p>
<p>Other local patents in this branch of industry on the Register
are:&mdash;</p>
<p>No. 8543&mdash;13th June, 1840&mdash;Joseph Wolverson,
locksmith, William Rawlett, latch maker, both of
Willenhall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Locks and latches.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>No. 8903&mdash;29 March, 1841.&mdash;James Tildesley,
of Willenhall, factor, and Joseph Sanders, of Wolverhampton, Lock
manufacturer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No. 10611&mdash;15th April, 1845.&mdash;George Carter, of
Willenhall, jobbing smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Locks and latches.</p>
<p>No. 12604&mdash;8th May, 1849.&mdash;Samuel Wilkes, of
Wednesfield Heath, brass founder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Knobs, handles,
and spindles for the same, and locks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[There are patents in the name of Samuel Wilkes, at Darlaston,
ironfounder, in 1840, for hinges; and for vices in the same
year.&nbsp; In 1851, Samuel Wilkes, of Wolverhampton, iron
founder, took out a patent for hinges.&nbsp; In 1845, Samuel
Wilkes, of Wolverhampton, brass founder, took out a patent for
kettles.&nbsp; The Wilkes&rsquo; family hereabouts are manifestly
as ingenious as they are numerous.]</p>
<p>At the present time there are some 90 factories and 143
workshop employers in Willenhall, besides nine factories and 47
workshops in the Short Heath district.&nbsp; The most important
firms in the lock trade are Messrs. Carpenter and Tildesley, H.
and T. Vaughan, William Vaughan, John Minors and Sons, J. Waine
and Sons, Beddow and Sturmey, Legge and Chilton, and Enoch Tonks
and Sons.&nbsp; In the casting trades are John Harper and Co.,
Ltd. (by far the largest concern), Wm. Harper, Son, and Co., C.
and L. Hill, H. and J. Hill, T. Pedley, H. and T. Vaughan (under
the style of D. Knowles and Sons), and Arthur Tipper.&nbsp; In
this branch of the industry women are largely employed, and
children to a slight extent, in attending to light hand and power
presses.&nbsp; Female labour is now utilised in the making of
parts of machine-made locks (a method of production introduced
during the last generation), and for varnishing, painting, and
bronzing both the machine and the hand-made goods.</p>
<p>The rate of wages for workmen in the lock trade now ranges
from 20s. to 35s. per week, yielding an average of about
29s.&nbsp; Of the wares produced there are probably 300
varieties, many of them in several sizes each, the gross output
running into thousands of dozens per week, and so great is their
diversity that they range <!-- page 165--><a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>from field
padlocks to ponderous prison locks, and the selling prices vary
from 1d. to 30s. each.&nbsp; They are exported all over the
world, finding good markets in Australasia and South Africa.</p>
<p>Tradition forbids that we should omit here the two stock
illustrations of the fact that lock-making ranks among the
notoriously ill-paid industries.&nbsp; One is the familiar
exaggeration that if a Willenhall locksmith happens to let fall
the lock he is making, he never stoops to pick up because he can
make another in less time.</p>
<p>The other is the hackneyed anecdote of the late G. B.
Thorneycroft, who was once taunted with the sneer that some
padlocks of local manufacture would only lock once; and who
promptly retorted that as they had been bought at twopence each,
it would be &ldquo;a shame if they did lock twice&rdquo; at such
starvation prices of production.&nbsp; But Willenhall&rsquo;s
contributions to the hardware production of the Black Country are
by no means limited to this endless variety of locks, some for
doors and gates, some for carpet bags and travelling trunks, some
for writing portfolios and jewel caskets; but extends to lock
furniture and door furniture, latches, door bolts, hasps and
keys, hooks and steel vermin traps, grid-irons and box-iron
stands, files and wood-screws, ferrules and iron-tips for
Lancashire clogs; and other small oddments of the hardware
trade.</p>
<p>The making of currycombs, though shrunk to somewhat
insignificant proportions within the last quarter of a century,
was once a very prominent industry in Willenhall.&nbsp; In 1815
James Carpenter, whose name is now so prominent in the lock
trade, took out a patent, which was registered as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>No. 3956&mdash;23rd August, 1815.&mdash;James
Carpenter, of Willenhall, curry comb maker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Improvements to a curry comb, by inverting the handle over
the back of the comb, and thus rendering the pressure, when in
use, more equal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another typical industry was the making of door-bolts, now
represented by the firms of Joseph Tipper, and Jonah Banks and
Sons.&nbsp; It is interesting to note that among the last of the
old trade tokens circulating in this locality, were the
Willenhall farthings issued by Austin, a miller, baker, and
grocer, who carried on <!-- page 166--><a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>business at
the corner of Stafford Street (the same now conducted by Joshua
Rushbrooke); the obverse of this coin bore as a design
characteristic of the town a padlock, a currycomb, and a
door-bolt, with the legend, &ldquo;Let Willenhall
flourish,&rdquo; and the date 1844.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Currycomb manufacture is now represented by D. Ferguson,
and by W. H. Tildesley, the latter adding to it the making of
steel traps.</p>
<p>But whatever loss has been incurred by the shrinkage of this
industry has been more than made up by the enormous growth of the
trade in stampings&mdash;keys are stamped&mdash;and in malleable
castings.</p>
<p>The earliest Willenhall patent was taken out in this branch of
trade, and thus specified: &ldquo;No. 3,800.&nbsp; 7th April,
1814.&nbsp; Isaac Mason, Willenhall, tea tray maker.&nbsp; Making
stamped front for register stoves and other stoves, fenders, tea
trays, and other trays, mouldings, and other articles, in brass
and other metals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the stamping trades at the present time are Messrs.
Armstrong, Stevens and Co., Vaughan Brothers, Alexander Lloyd and
Sons, Baxter, Vaughan, and Co., and J. B. Brooks and Co.&nbsp; At
the works of Messrs. John Harper and Co., by far the largest in
the town, a variety of hardware articles are produced, besides
locks, but the bulk of their trade is in the production of
castings, especially in the form of gas and oil stoves and
lamps.&nbsp; New developments continue to bring in fresh
industries.</p>

<h2><!-- page 167--><a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>XXVIII.&mdash;Willenhall in
Fiction.</h2>
<p>A vivid picture of the social and industrial conditions which
formerly prevailed in this locality has been drawn by the
masterly pen of Disraeli, who evidently studied this side of the
Black Country at close quarters.&nbsp; It occurs in his novel,
&ldquo;Sybil,&rdquo; the time of action being about 1837.</p>
<p>The distinguished novelist discovered the well-known fact that
many of the common people hereabout were ignorant of their own
names, and that if they knew them few indeed were able to spell
them.&nbsp; Of nicknames, which were then not merely prevalent,
but practically universal, he gives us such choice examples as
Devilsdust, Chatting Jack, and Dandy Mick; while in
&ldquo;Shuttle and Screw&rsquo;s Mill,&rdquo; and the firm of
&ldquo;Truck and Trett,&rdquo; we recognise names significant of
the methods of employment then in vogue.</p>
<p>But worse perhaps than the &ldquo;truck system&rdquo; of
paying wages in kind instead of in coin, was the prevailing
system of utilising an inordinate number of apprentices; and as
these were almost invariably &ldquo;parish apprentices,&rdquo;
the output of the local workhouses, the tendency was not only to
lower the rate of wages, but to lower the morale of the
people.</p>
<p>How this tendency worked out in everyday life is best seen in
the following extract from &ldquo;Sybil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under the
fictional name &ldquo;Wemsbury&rdquo; may perhaps be read
Wednesbury; &ldquo;Hell House Yard&rdquo; is evidently meant for
Hell Lane, near Sedgley; and as to &ldquo;Wodgate,&rdquo; there
can be no doubt about its interpretation as Wednesfield.&nbsp;
This is Disraeli&rsquo;s description of life here seventy years
ago, no doubt viewed as it was approached from the Wolverhampton
side:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Wodgate, or Wogate, as it was called on the map,
was a district that in old days had been consecrated to Woden,
and which appeared destined through successive ages to retain its
heathen character.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the revolutionary war Wodgate was a sort
of squatting district of the great mining region to which <!--
page 168--><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>it was contiguous, a place where adventurers in the
industry which was rapidly developed settled themselves; for
though the great veins of coal and ironstone cropped up, as they
phrase it, before they reached this bare and barren land, and it
was thus deficient in those mineral and metallic treasures which
had enriched its neighbourhood, Wodgate had advantages of its
own, and of a kind which touch the fancy of the lawless.</p>
<p>It was land without an owner; no one claimed any manorial
right over it; they could build cottages without paying
rent.&nbsp; It was a district recognised by no parish; so there
were no tithes and no meddlesome supervision.&nbsp; It abounded
in fuel which cost nothing, for though the veins were not worth
working as a source of mining profit, the soil of Wodgate was
similar in its superficial character to that of the country
around.</p>
<p>So a population gathered, and rapidly increased in the ugliest
spot in England, to which neither Nature nor art had contributed
a single charm; where a tree could not be seen, a flower was
unknown, where there was neither belfry nor steeple, nor a single
sight or sound that could soften the heart or humanize the
mind.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the cause, whether, as not unlikely,
the original squatters brought with them some traditionary skill,
or whether their isolated and unchequered existence concentrated
their energies on their craft, the fact is certain, that the
inhabitants of Wodgate early acquired a celebrity as skilful
workmen.</p>
<p>This reputation so much increased, and in time spread so far,
that, for more than a quarter of a century, both in their skill
and the economy of their labour, they have been unmatched
throughout the country.</p>
<p>As manufacturers of ironmongery they carry the palm from the
whole district; as founders of brass and workers of steel they
fear none; while as nailers and locksmiths, their <!-- page
169--><a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>fame has spread even to the European markets whither
their most skilful workmen have frequently been invited.</p>
<p>Invited in vain!&nbsp; No wages can tempt the Wodgate man from
his native home, that squatters&rsquo; seat which soon assumed
the form of a large village, and then in turn soon expanded into
a town, and at the present moment numbers its population by
swarming thousands, lodged in the most miserable tenements, in
the most hideous burgh, in the ugliest country in the world.</p>
<p>But it has its enduring spell.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the
spread of its civic prosperity, it has lost none of the
characteristics of its original society; on the contrary, it has
zealously preserved them.&nbsp; There are no landlords,
head-lessees, main-masters, or butties in Wodgate.</p>

</a></p>
<p>No church there has yet raised its spire; and, as if the
jealous spirit of Woden still haunted his ancient temple, even
the conventicle scarcely dare show his humble front in some
obscure corner.&nbsp; There is no municipality, no magistrate;
there are no local acts, no vestries, no schools of any
kind.&nbsp; The streets are never cleaned; every man lights his
own house; nor does any one know anything except his
business.</p>

<p>More than this, at Wodgate, a factory or large establishment
of any kind is unknown.&nbsp; Here Labour reigns supreme.&nbsp;
Its division, indeed, is favoured by their manners, but the
interference or influence of mere capital is instantly
resisted.</p>
<p>The business of Wodgate is carried on by master workmen in
their own houses, each of whom possess an unlimited number of
what they call apprentices, by whom their affairs are principally
conducted, and whom they treat as the Mamlouks treated the
Egyptians.</p>
<p>These master workmen indeed form a powerful aristocracy, nor
is it possible to conceive one apparently more oppressive.&nbsp;
They are ruthless tyrants; they habitually inflict upon their
subjects punishments more grievous than the slave population of
our colonies were ever visited with; not content with beating
them with sticks, or flogging them with <!-- page 170--><a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>knotted
ropes, they are in the habit of felling them with, or cutting
their heads open with a file or lock.</p>
<p>The most usual punishment, however, or rather stimulus to
increase exertion, is to pull an apprentice&rsquo;s ears till
they run with blood.&nbsp; These youths, too, are worked for
sixteen or even twenty hours a day; they are often sold by one
master to another; they are fed on carrion, and they sleep in
lofts or cellars.</p>
<p>Yet, whether it be that they are hardened by brutality, and
really unconscious of their degradation and unusual sufferings,
or whether they are supported by the belief that their day to be
masters and oppressors will surely arrive, the aristocracy of
Wodgate is by no means so unpopular as the aristocracy of most
other places.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is a real aristocracy; it is
privileged, but it does something for its privileges.&nbsp; It is
distinguished from the main body, not merely by name.&nbsp; It is
the most knowing class at Wodgate; it possesses, in deed, in its
way, complete knowledge; and it imparts in its manner a certain
quantity of it to those whom it guides.</p>
<p>Thus it is an aristocracy that leads, and therefore a
fact.&nbsp; Moreover, the social system of Wodgate is not an
unvarying course of infinite toil.&nbsp; Their plan is to work
hard, but not always.&nbsp; They seldom exceed four days of
labour in the week.&nbsp; On Sunday the masters begin to drink;
for the apprentices there is dog-fighting without any stint.</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday the whole population of Wodgate is
drunk; of all stations, ages, and sexes, even babes who should be
at the breast, for they are drammed with Godfrey&rsquo;s
cordial.&nbsp; Here is relaxation, excitement; if less vice
otherwise than might be at first anticipated, we must remember
that excesses are checked by poverty of blood and constant
exhaustion.&nbsp; Scanty food and hard labour are in their way,
if not exactly moralists, a tolerably good police.</p>
<p>There are no others at Wodgate to preach or to control.&nbsp;
It is not that the people are immoral, for immorality implies
<!-- page 171--><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>some forethought; or ignorant, for ignorance is
relative; but they are animals, unconscious, their minds a blank,
and their worst actions only the impulse of a gross or savage
instinct.&nbsp; There are many in this town who are ignorant of
their very names; very few who can spell them.</p>
<p>It is rare that you meet with a young person who knows his own
age; rarer to find the boy who has seen a book, or the girl who
has seen a flower.&nbsp; Ask them the name of their Sovereign,
and they will give you an unmeaning stare; ask them the name of
their religion, and they will laugh; who rules them on earth, or
who can save them in Heaven, are alike mysteries to them.</p>
<p>Such was the population with whom Morley was about to
mingle.&nbsp; Wodgate had the appearance of a vast squalid
suburb.&nbsp; As you advanced, leaving behind you long lines of
little dingy tenements, with infants lying about the road, you
expected every moment to emerge into some streets, and encounter
buildings bearing some correspondence, in their size and comfort,
to the considerable population swarming and busied around
you.</p>
<p>Nothing of the kind.&nbsp; There were no public buildings of
any sort; no churches, chapels, town hall, institute, theatre;
and the principal streets in the heart of the town in which were
situate the coarse and grimy shops, though formed by houses of a
greater elevation than the preceding, were equally narrow, and,
if possible, more dirty.</p>
<p>At every fourth or fifth house, alleys, seldom above a yard
wide, and streaming with filth, opened out of the street.&nbsp;
These were crowded with dwellings of various size, while from the
principal court often branched out a number of smaller alleys, or
rather narrow passages, than which nothing can be conceived more
close and squalid and obscure.</p>
<p>Here, during the days of business, the sound of the hammer and
the file never ceased, amid gutters of abomination, and piles of
foulness; and stagnant pools of filth, reservoirs of leprosy and
plague, whose exhalations were <!-- page 172--><a
name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>sufficient
to taint the atmosphere of the whole kingdom, and fill the
country with fever and pestilence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such were the conditions of life in Willenhall, at least from
the industrial side; for Willenhall and Wednesfield were at that
time almost identical in their industrial, social, and municipal
economics.&nbsp; The novelist is, of course, incorrect in saying
Wednesfield had no church; as we have seen in Chapter XXIII. it
had possessed a small church or chapel since 1746.</p>
<p>Another novelist who has dealt with the same theme is Louis
Becke.&nbsp; The hero of his tale, entitled &ldquo;Old Convict
Days&rdquo; (published by T. Fisher Unwin), is a runaway
apprentice from Darlaston; and Willenhall is alluded to in this
work as &ldquo;Wilnon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Spirited descriptions are
given of regular set fights between the apprentices of the two
towns, which took place on the canal bridge that divided their
respective territories near Bug Hole, and in the course of which
drownings have not been unknown to occur.&nbsp; Allusions are
also made to the dog-fighting, human rat worrying, and other
brutal sports with which the populace of these two places were
wont to amuse themselves; and particularly to the haunted Red
Barn in which a murder had been committed.</p>
<p>Willenhall can lay a further claim to classic ground in the
realm of fiction, though the exact spot has not yet been
satisfactorily identified.&nbsp; It is the place called
Mumper&rsquo;s Dingle, in the works of George Borrow, the gipsy
traveller and linguist, or as he calls himself in the Romany
dialect, Lavengro, the &ldquo;Word-Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word &ldquo;mumper&rdquo; signifies a tramp or roving
beggar; but its slight likeness to the name Monmer has led
certain local enthusiasts to identify Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle with
Monmer Lane.&nbsp; Wherever this particular gipsies&rsquo; dingle
may have been, it was certainly on the Essington side of
Willenhall, though scarcely five miles out; in fact, the
public-house mentioned in the narrative (&ldquo;Lavengro,&rdquo;
chapter 89) is generally understood to be the Bull&rsquo;s Head
Inn, Wolverhampton Street, which is definitely stated to be two
miles from Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle.&nbsp; It must have been a
secluded and romantic spot about the year 1820, and quite a
fitting scene for that interesting episode of the gipsy life
described as being led <!-- page 173--><a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>there by
the unconventional Lavengro, in Platonic association with a
strapping Gitano wench named Isopel Berners.</p>
<p>Since George Borrow has come to be recognised as a writer
fitting to rank among our standard English authors, quite a
Borrovian cult has grown up, which has naturally enough fortified
itself by a literature of its own.</p>
<p>Our first extracts are the great writer&rsquo;s own
description of the place.&nbsp; (&ldquo;Isopel Berners,&rdquo; by
George Borrow.)</p>
<blockquote><p>The Dingle is a deep, wooded, and, consequently,
somewhat gloomy hollow in the middle of a very large, desolate
field.&nbsp; The shelving sides of the hollow are overgrown with
trees and bushes.&nbsp; A belt of sallows crowns the circular
edge of the small crater.&nbsp; At the lowest part of the Dingle
are discovered a stone and a fire of charcoal, from which spot a
winding path ascends to &ldquo;the plain.&rdquo;&nbsp; On either
side of the fire is a small encampment.&nbsp; One consists of a
small pony cart and a small hut-shaped tent, occupied by the
Word-Master, on the other side is erected a kind of tent,
consisting of large hoops covered over with tarpaulin, quite
impenetrable to rain; hard by stands a small donkey cart.&nbsp;
This is &ldquo;the tabernacle&rdquo; of Isopel Berners.&nbsp; A
short distance off, near a spring of clear water, is the
encampment of the Romany chals and chies&mdash;the Petulengres
and their small clan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The place is above five miles from Willenhall, in
Staffordshire.</p>
<p>The time is July, 1825.</p>
<p>Our concluding quotation is taken from the &ldquo;Life,
Writings, and Correspondence of George Borrow,&rdquo; by William
J. Knapp (published in 1899).</p>
<blockquote><p>1825.</p>
<p>On the 21st, he departs with his itinerant hosts towards the
old Welsh border&mdash;Montgomery.&nbsp; Turns back with Ambrose
Petulengro.&nbsp; Settles in Mumber Lane, Staffordshire, near
Willenhall.&nbsp; My informant of Dudley caused it to be found,
and wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><!-- page 174--><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mumpers&rsquo; Dingle&rsquo; still exists
in the neighbourhood of Willenhall, though it does not seem to be
well known, as a native had to make inquiries about it.&nbsp;
Willenhall itself is one of the most forlorn-looking places in
the Black Country, ranking second to Darlaston, I should
think.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><!-- page 175--><a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>XXIX.&mdash;Bibliography.</h2>
<p>From the merely allusive in literature, we proceed to the
bibliography of Willenhall, which, though not extensive, is of
fair average interest.</p>
<p>Recently (June, 1907) was put up for auction in London a First
Folio Shakespeare of some local interest.&nbsp; It was the
property of Mr. Abel Buckley, Ryecroft Hall, near
Manchester.&nbsp; This folio appears to have been purchased about
1660 by Colonel John Lane, of Bentley Hall, Staffs, the protector
of Charles II. after the Battle of Worcester.&nbsp; It remained
in the possession of the family till 1856, when, at the dispersal
of the library of Colonel John Lane, of King&rsquo;s Bromley,
whose book-plate, designed by Hogarth, is inserted, it was bought
by the third Earl of Gosford for 157 guineas.</p>
<p>The son of the third Earl of Gosford disposed of it to James
Toovey, the famous London bookseller, for &pound;470 in 1884; and
soon afterwards Mr. Buckley obtained the folio.&nbsp; It measures
12&#8542;in. by 8&frac14;in., is throughout clean, but the
fly-leaf and title are mounted and two leaves repaired.&nbsp;
This is the volume&rsquo;s interesting history, according to Mr.
Sidney Lee.</p>
<p>In 1795, Stephen Chatterton, a Willenhall schoolmaster,
published a book of poems of a humorous cast.&nbsp; One is
&ldquo;An epistle to my friend Mr. Thomas S&mdash;, who was
married in July, 1783, to his third wife, on his fiftieth
birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bibliography of the Rev. Samuel Cozens, at one time
minister of the Peculiar Baptists&rsquo; Chapel at Little London,
Willenhall, is rather extensive if not very interesting.&nbsp; A
full list of his pamphlets and other works will be found in G. T.
Lawley&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bibliography of Wolverhampton,&rdquo; and
also in Simms&rsquo; &ldquo;Bibliotheca
Staffordiensis.&rdquo;&nbsp; His first work, which appeared in
the &ldquo;Gospel Standard,&rdquo; 1844, was &ldquo;A short
account of the Lord&rsquo;s Gracious Dealings with One of the
Elect Vessels of Mercy,&rdquo; and is autobiographical.</p>
<p>From this title, and that of the second part of his life,
which appeared in 1857, &ldquo;Reminiscences: or Footsteps of
Providence,&rdquo; <!-- page 176--><a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>the attitude of mind assumed by the
writer may be easily guessed.&nbsp; His was a dogmatic creed, of
stern unyielding Calvinism, which left him always self-satisfied,
and often made him aggressive.&nbsp; He moved from Wolverhampton
to Willenhall in 1848, where his first book was written, a
scholarly volume in the form of &ldquo;A Biblical
Lexicon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently his combative nature found expression in a
controversial pamphlet attacking the Primitive Methodists,
&ldquo;John Wesley, the Papa of British Rome, and Philip Pugh,
the modern Pelagius, weighed in the Balance of Eternal Truth and
found wanting&rdquo; (Willenhall, printed and published by W. H.
Hughes, 1852).&nbsp; The Rev. Philip Pugh was located at
Darlaston, and made a gallant defence on behalf of his
co-religionists; the Primitive Methodists of Willenhall
acknowledging these services by presenting him with a handsome
testimonial.&nbsp; The pamphlets containing his rejoinders bear
the imprint of Stephen Hackett, Willenhall.&nbsp; Mr. Cozens died
in Tasmania some years later.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Memoirs of G. B. Thorneycroft,&rdquo; written by
the Rev. J. B. Owen, and published (Wolverhampton: T. Simpson) in
1856, contain local allusions of minor interest.&nbsp; The
subject of the memoir was the well-known South Staffordshire
ironmaster, who in the earlier part of his commercial career had
some works near the Waterglade, on the Bilston Road.</p>
<p>George Benjamin Thorneycroft, was born August 20th, 1791, at
Tipton, where his grandfather kept the Three Furnaces Inn.&nbsp;
His biographer claims his descent from the Thornicrofts of
Cheshire.&nbsp; In his youth he was employed at Kirkstall Forge,
near Leeds, returning to Staffordshire in 1809 to work at the
Moorcroft Ironworks at Bradley, near Bilston, where, by his skill
and industry he ultimately rose to the management.</p>
<p>It was in 1817 he founded a small ironwork at Willenhall, and
seven years later joined his twin brother, Edward Thorneycroft,
in establishing the Shrubbery Ironworks at Wolverhampton.&nbsp;
The rise of the railways at that period, and the consequent
larger demands for iron and steel, were among the causes which
led to his great prosperity as an ironmaster.</p>
<p><!-- page 177--><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>His Willenhall residence was on the site now occupied
by the Metropolitan Bank, in the Market Place: while his works,
this first this iron magnate owned, were located near what is now
known as Forge Yard, Waterglade Street.&nbsp; It was in this
house his son, Colonel Thorneycroft, of Tettenhall Towers, was
born.</p>

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>His prominence as a public man may be estimated by the fact
that when Wolverhampton was incorporated in 1848, Mr.
Thorneycroft was selected for the honour of being first Mayor of
the new borough.&nbsp; He was at all times a generous supporter
of every local charity and benevolent institution, till the old
quotation came to be fitted to him:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There was a man&mdash;the neighbours thought him
mad&mdash;<br />
The more he gave away, the more he had.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Town Hall of Wolverhampton a statue has been set up to
commemorate the public work of this estimable character.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Although during the greater portion of his career a great
supporter of the State Church, in earlier life Mr. G. B.
Thorneycroft had been an ardent Wesleyan; and in his memoirs (p.
134) it is recorded how he liquidated the burden of debt on the
Willenhall Chapel belonging to that denomination.&nbsp; On his
death, in 1851, among those who testified to his public
usefulness, and the estimation in which he was held, was the Rev.
G. H. Fisher, of Willenhall (memoirs pp. 263&ndash;5).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Willenhall Magazine&rdquo; was the name of a
monthly periodical launched in 1862, &ldquo;published for the
proprietors by J. Loxton, Market Place, Willenhall,&rdquo; and
having Messrs. J. C. and Jesse Tildesley as its chief
contributors.&nbsp; The first number appeared in March, and
twelve months afterwards this praiseworthy attempt to establish a
local magazine in Willenhall had completely failed.</p>

<p>In 1866 appeared a religious novel written by a Primitive
Methodist preacher of this town, and published by Elliot Stock,
London.&nbsp; It: was entitled &ldquo;Nest: A Tale of the Early
British Christians,&rdquo; by the Rev. J. Boxer,
Willenhall.&nbsp; Mr. G. T. Lawley describes it as a well-written
story dealing with the pagan persecution of the early British
Christians by their Saxon conquerors.</p>
<p><!-- page 178--><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>A story of direct local interest was Mr. G. T.
Lawley&rsquo;s work &ldquo;The Locksmith&rsquo;s Apprentice; a
Tale of Old Willenhall,&rdquo; published serially some years ago
in the columns of a Wolverhampton weekly newspaper.</p>
<p>Mr N. Neal Solly (of the firm of Fletcher, Solly, and Urwick,
Willenhall Furnaces) wrote the Guide to the Fine Arts Section of
the South Staffordshire Exhibition, held at Molineux House,
Wolverhampton, in 1869.&nbsp; The writer was himself an artist,
and he afterwards produced some valuable Memoirs of David Cox
(1873), and of the Bristol painter, William James Muller
(1875).</p>
<p>The most eminent litterateur Willenhall has produced is Mr.
James Carpenter Tildesley, a lock manufacturer, as we have seen,
and a life-long public man in the town.&nbsp; Reference has
already been made to his writings on industrial subjects, and
also to his works on the history of local Methodism.&nbsp; As a
public man, he is a Justice of the Peace for the County, a
chairman of Willenhall Petty Sessional Division, has been
president of the Wolverhampton Chamber of Commerce, chairman of
the Willenhall Local Board, and chairman of the Willenhall
Liberal Association.&nbsp; Since his retirement to Penkridge he
has written a history of that parish, which was published by
Steen and Co., of Wolverhampton, in 1886.</p>
<p>Mr. J. C. Tildesley was sub-editor of the &ldquo;Birmingham
Morning News&rdquo; under the famous George Dawson, and has been
a most diligent contributor to the Press for the last forty
years.&nbsp; It was mainly by his efforts that the Willenhall
Literary Institute was founded, that what is now the Public Hall
was built, and that the Free Library was established.</p>
<p>In recognition of his work in connection with the Literary
Institute, a public presentation was made to him, the inscription
upon which bore this eloquent testimony&mdash;&ldquo;Not to
requite but to record services of great value to Willenhall . .
.&nbsp; January 4th, 1869.&rdquo;&nbsp; That Mr. J. C. Tildesley
is now permanently invalided is a matter of regret not only to
Willenhall, but to a wide circle of readers and admirers outside
the township.</p>
<h2><!-- page 179--><a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>XXX.&mdash;Topography.</h2>
<p>There is often a wealth of history to be unearthed from
place-names.&nbsp; Localities often preserve the names of dead
and gone personages, half-forgotten incidents, and matters of
past history well worth recalling for their interest.&nbsp;
Besides the pleasure to be derived from the right interpretation
of place-names and old street names, great interest often centres
around the social associations of old inns and taverns.&nbsp; Let
us consider a few of the old-time inns and localities of
Willenhall.</p>
<p>The site of the medi&aelig;val Holy Well, which in the later
fashion of the 18th century blossomed forth as a Spa, was
situated between the church and the present Manor House.&nbsp; In
the remoter age we may imagine it as the haunt of the lame, the
halt, and the blind (possibly the church was dedicated to St.
Giles, the patron of cripples, on this account), and in the more
recent period as the resort of fashionable invalids and wealthy
valetudinarians.</p>
<p>In the Private Act of Parliament, dated 6th August, 1844, for
disposing of the Willenhall Endowment properties, a number of
field-names occur in the schedule which are pregnant with local
history.&nbsp; Welch End is a name which seems to mark the
locality where resided the family of Welch, who founded the
church dole; the Doctor&rsquo;s Piece was perhaps part of the
estate of the celebrated Dr. Wilkes; the Clothers and the Little
Clothiers are names which are said to indicate certain lands once
belonging to the Cloth-workers&rsquo; Company of the City of
London; Somerford Bridge Piece and the Hither Bathing were
presumably located near the brook; while the Poor&rsquo;s Piece,
the Constable&rsquo;s Dole, and the Dole&rsquo;s Butty (query:
does the last-named, interpreted in the dialect of the district,
signify &ldquo;the companion piece to the Dole?&rdquo;), are
names which suggest the identity of charity lands.</p>
<p>There is mention of a High Causeway, which manifestly
indicates the position of some old paved road; and the Butts,
doubtless, named the field where in ancient times archery was
<!-- page 180--><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>practised by the men of Willenhall, as the men of
Darlaston did at the Butcroft in their parish.</p>
<p>Reverting to the schedule, there are some names for which no
explanation can be offered; as Ell Park, Berry Stile, the
Stringes, and the Farther Stringes.&nbsp; Many of the properties
named in the list are declared to be &ldquo;uninclosed lands that
lie dispersedly in the Common Fields there, intermixed with other
lands.&rdquo;&nbsp; How much, or rather, how little, common land
is there in Willenhall to-day?</p>
<p>And yet the amount of &ldquo;waste&rdquo; land in and around
Willenhall was once excessive, as the writings of George Borrow
cannot fail to convey (Chap. XXVIII.).&nbsp; In Chap. XXII. we
read of Canne Byrch, situated in &ldquo;Willenhall Field,&rdquo;
lying in the highway towards Darlaston, where perhaps the village
community of ancient times tilled their lands in common; and more
directly of the &ldquo;waste or common land&rdquo; called
Shepwell Green; a wide stretch of open land once apparently
stretching away towards the wilderness and solitudes of that
gipsy-land immortalised by George Borrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willenhall Green&rdquo; is named by Dr. Plot, writing
in 1686, as a place where yellow ochre was found a yard below the
surface, and which after being beaten up was made into oval cakes
to be sold at fourpence a dozen to glovers, who used it in
combination with cakes of &ldquo;blew clay,&rdquo; found at
Darlaston and Wednesbury, &ldquo;for giving their wares an ash
colour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old highway between Walsall and Wolverhampton lay along
Walsall Street, through Cross Street, and the Market Place; the
new coach route, or the New Road, as it was called, was made in
the early part of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>New Invention is a place-name which originated not from any
connection with the local industries, as one might be led to
expect, but from nothing more serious than a nickname of
derision.&nbsp; The tradition is that many years ago an
inhabitant from the centre of the town was strolling out that
way, when he was thus accosted by an acquaintance living in one
of the few cottages which then comprised the neighbourhood, and
who was standing on his own doorstep to enjoy the cool of the
evening: &ldquo;I say, Bill, hast <!-- page 181--><a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>seen my new
invention?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, lad; what is it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; said the self-satisfied
householder, pointing up to a hawthorn bush which was pushed out
of the top of his chimney.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s stopped our o&rsquo;d chimdy smokin&rsquo;, I can tell
thee!&rdquo;&nbsp; And ever after that the locality which this
worthy honoured with his ingenious presence was slyly dubbed by
his amused neighbours the &ldquo;New Invention,&rdquo; by which
name it afterwards became generally known.</p>
<p>Portobello, on the outskirts of Willenhall, is said to have
borrowed its name from that second-hand Portobello near Leith,
which was named after Admiral Vernon&rsquo;s famous victory of
1739.&nbsp; At the Scottish suburb a bed of rich clay, discovered
in 1765, led to the development of the place through the
establishment of brick and tile works; a similar discovery of a
thick bed of clay outside Willenhall, and its subsequent
industrial development on parallel lines led to the copying of
that patriotic name, more particularly because a neighbouring
coal-pit was already rejoicing in the name of Bunker&rsquo;s
Hill, conferred upon it by local patriots after the American
victory of 1775.&nbsp; The Willenhall wags, however, have given
quite another derivation.&nbsp; A man once passing a solitary
farmhouse in that locality, say they, called and inquired if the
farmer had any beer on tap.&nbsp; The reply was, as the man
pointed cellarwards, &ldquo;No&mdash;only porter
below!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little London seems to be a locality which attempts to shine
by the reflected glory of the capital&rsquo;s borrowed name, and
is appropriately approached by a thoroughfare called Temple Bar;
but which of these metropolitan names suggested the other, the
oldest inhabitant fails to recollect.</p>
<p>Among the old inns and taverns of the town the chief were the
Neptune Inn, Walsall Street; the Bull&rsquo;s Head, Wolverhampton
Street; the Hope and Anchor, Little London; the Bell Inn, Market
Place; and the Waterglade Tavern, Waterglade.&nbsp; The Neptune,
situated on the main road between Wolverhampton and Walsall, and
almost opposite the church, was formerly a posting-house kept in
the 18th and early part of the 19th century by Isaac Hartill, one
of those typical hosts of the coaching period; active, <!-- page
182--><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>genial, and obliging, a man of good conversational
powers, and one who instantly made his guests feel at home, and
was extremely popular with all the local gentry and regular
travellers along the road.&nbsp; With the advent of the railway
the character of the Neptune Inn gradually altered&mdash;the
railway, by the way, was cut through the crescent, overlooking
Bentley Hall, a property which had belonged to and had been the
residence of the Hartill family since 1704, and part of which is
now The Robin Hood Grounds, used for sports and recreations and
other out-door assemblies.</p>
<p>It was from the balcony above the entry of the Neptune Inn,
over which was then the public drawing-room, that the Right Hon.
Charles P. Villiers first addressed the electors of the
newly-enfranchised borough of Wolverhampton in 1835, and
subsequently made many of his fervent Free Trade speeches; and in
fact, from this place all public announcements were wont to be
made.&nbsp; The room behind the balcony was formerly used as a
Court Room, in which the magistrates administered justice; here
too, the Willenhall Court Leet was held, and to this day Lord
Barnard&rsquo;s agents receive the tithes there.</p>
<p>The Neptune once served all the purposes of a lending inn as
an acknowledged place of public rendezvous; and when the
Stowheath farmers were accustomed to ride or drive in to attend
church, its spacious stableyard was a scene of animation, even on
Sundays.</p>
<p>The Bell Inn, in the Market Place, is perhaps the oldest in
the market taverns, though the date 1660 painted upon its sign
can scarcely refer to the projecting wing which bears it.&nbsp;
The back portion of the house is unquestionably old; in fact, the
family of Wakelam who kept the inn 25 years ago, were identified
with this house and the Bull&rsquo;s Head Inn for upwards of two
centuries.</p>
<p>The Plough Inn, Stafford Street, is less old than the others,
and of more doubtful interest.&nbsp; It has been completely
altered within recent years; in the old days when prisoners
consigned to Stafford Gaol had to walk, it was the place of the
final drink before starting, and marked the limits of the town

183</span>The Bull&rsquo;s head Inn, Wolverhampton Street, is
supposed to be the alehouse referred to in Borrow&rsquo;s
romantic tale of Romany life, &ldquo;Lavengro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Waterglade Tavern marked the spot on the road between the
two old-world villages of Willenhall and Bilston, where it dipped
to the bed of the stream.</p>
<p>The Woolpack Inn, at Short Heath, is one of the oldest
licensed houses in that locality.</p>
<p>The First and Last Inn, New Invention, was so dubbed because
at one time it was the first licensed house when approaching from
Wednesfield, and the last when going the other way out.</p>
<p>The sign rhymes of Willenhall belong to the hackneyed
type.&nbsp; The Gate Inn, New Invention, has the well-known
couplet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>This Gate hangs well and hinders none:<br />
Refresh and pay and travel on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Lame Dog Inn, at Short Heath, is not very original
with:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Step in, my friends, and stop a while,<br />
To help a lame dog over the stile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enough has been said on the subject to arouse the interest of
patriotic Willenhaleans.&nbsp; One reflection in
conclusion&mdash;in the old days licensed houses were invariably
kept by families of position and substance, and it is remarkable
to discover the great number of professional and well-to-do men
of the present day who were born in public-houses.&nbsp; It is so
with regard to Wednesbury and Darlaston, and even more so with
regard to Willenhall.</p>

<h2><!-- page 184--><a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>XXXI.&mdash;Old Families and Names
of Note.</h2>
<p>To not a few of the old names of those who have lived their
lives in Willenhall, and left their mark indelibly fixed upon its
annals, attention has already been paid in treating of the
various matters with which their respective life-work was
associated.&nbsp; It remains here only to add a few more names to
our list of Willenhall worthies, and to supplement a few
biographical details to those already mentioned.</p>
<p>The index to the names of landowners would be incomplete
without that of Offley.&nbsp; In the year 1555 Alderman Offley, a
citizen of London, acquired lands in &ldquo;Willenhall, otherwise
Wilnall.&rdquo;&nbsp; About the same date this opulent merchant
became lord of the manor of Darlaston.&nbsp; (See History of
Darlaston, pp. 39&ndash;40.)</p>
<p>An important old Willenhall family, as may have been gathered
in the course of these Annals, was that of Hincks.&nbsp; Their
family residence still stands in Bilston Street, near to the
Market Place; a descendant, and apparently the only
representative of the Hincks family surviving is Mrs. Samuel
Walker, of Bentley Hall.</p>
<p>Of Carpenter, Willenhall&rsquo;s most famous inventor, a few
more items of local and biographical interest are
forthcoming.&nbsp; In early life James Carpenter was a Churchman,
but, as many other Willenhall folk did, became a Wesleyan in
consequence of the scandals caused by the Rev. Mr.
Moreton&rsquo;s mode of life.&nbsp; His remains lie in a vault on
the east side of the Wesleyan Chapel in Union Street.&nbsp; He
was a keen supporter of the Right Hon. C. P. Villiers when he
first became a Parliamentary candidate for Wolverhampton.</p>
<p>John Austin, the tradesman, who first issued the
&ldquo;Willenhall farthings,&rdquo; mentioned in Chapter XXVII.,
was an enterprising tradesman, a man of handsome presence and of
an alert mind.&nbsp; On leaving Willenhall he went to live at
Manor House, Allscott, near Wellington, at which town he
established artificial manure works, and where he manufactured
sulphuric acid very extensively.</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>The issue of the Willenhall trade farthings was
continued by Rushbrooke, his successor in the business (1853),
though the original date, &ldquo;1844&rdquo; was always retained
upon them.&nbsp; They were sold to shopkeepers and traders all
round the district at the rate of 5s. nominal for 4s. 9d.
cash.&nbsp; When the new national bronze coinage came into
circulation in 1860, large quantities of these copper farthing
tokens were returned on to Mr Rushbrooke&rsquo;s hands, but he
melted them down without sustaining the least loss.</p>

<p>The Hartill family has long been settled in Willenhall.&nbsp;
George Hartill married Isabel Cross, at St. Peter&rsquo;s Church,
Wolverhampton, in 1662.&nbsp; All their nine children were
baptised at St. Giles&rsquo;s Church, Willenhall.&nbsp; The
present Dr. J. T. Hartill is descended directly from Richard,
fifth son of the above, and his grandfather, Isaac Hartill,
inter-married with Ann Hartill, a descendant of the said George
Hartill&rsquo;s second son.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The social rank of the Hartills since their residence in
Willenhall has been that of tradesmen or professional men,
manufacturers, or small property owners, but always educated up
to the standard of the period in which they lived.&nbsp; In 1826
Jeremiah Hartill established himself in medical practice, joined
in 1861 by his nephew, William Henry Hartill, and in 1869 by the
latter&rsquo;s brother, Dr. J. T. Hartill.&nbsp; The arms and
crest borne by the last-named were formally granted him in 1896;
but the same coat without the crest had always been used by his
uncle Jeremiah, and that on a claim of inheritance from the
ancient lords of the manor of Hartill, in Cheshire, to whom it
had been granted by King John.&nbsp; These particular arms have
not been officially recorded at the College of Heralds since
1580, but a very similar coat was used by a member of this family
in 1703.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The Willenhall Hartills migrated here from the neighbourhood
of Kinver, Wolverley, and Kidderminster.&nbsp; There are still
Hartills of the old stock resident in the Kinver district, and
from them are descended Mrs. Shakespeare, wife of the well-known
Birmingham solicitor; and Mrs. Showell, wife of the late Walter
Showell, the founder of the eminent firm of Black Country
brewers, who was once a Parliamentary candidate for one of the
divisions <!-- page 186--><a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>of Birmingham.&nbsp; The Hartills of
Kinver are related to the Hartills of Kingsbury, and there has
always been a great similarity in the Christian names borne by
the old Kingsbury, Kinver, and Willenhall Hartills.&nbsp; The
steeple of Polesworth church was built by the last Sir Richard
Hartill, 1377&ndash;1379, and below the tower battlements is
carved upon a large shield the arms of this benefactor, which are
identical with those of the late Dr. Jeremiah Hartill of
Willenhall.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Vaughan, the founder of the largest business concern
in the town, has done a large amount of public work in various
capacities, but chiefly as a magistrate, a member of the defunct
School Board, and more recently as a County Councillor.</p>

<p>Among the justices who have sat on the Willenhall Bench and
possessed other connections with the place may be mentioned the
late N. Neal Solly, ironmaster, two water-colour drawings by whom
hang on the walls of the Free Library; the late Rev. G. H.
Fisher, who was chairman; R. D. Gough, a brother of the late
Colonel Foster Gough, and who married the rich and benevolent
Mary Clemson, daughter of John Clemson, a corn miller, of this
township; while among the most recent appointments are Clement
Tildesley, Thomas Vaughan, and Thomas Kidson.&nbsp; The present
Clerk to the Willenhall Bench is Samuel Mills Slater, in
succession to his father, the late James Slater, of Bescot
Hall.</p>
<p>A memorial tablet to the local men who fell in the Boer War
has been erected at the gateway to the Old Cemetery.</p>

<h2><!-- page 187--><a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>XXXII.&mdash;Manners and
Customs.</h2>
<p>The Manners and Customs of the people of Willenhall have been
those held in common with the populace of the surrounding
parishes, and which have been dealt with too fully in the
published writings of Mr. G. T. Lawley to need more than a brief
review here.</p>
<p>The seasonal custom of Well Dressing has been alluded to in
Chapter XVII., and of Beating the Bounds in Chapter V.&nbsp;
Other ancient customs of minor import existed, but space cannot
be found to treat them in a general history.</p>
<p>The social calibre of the people a century or so ago may be
gauged by a local illustration of the custom of Wife Selling.</p>
<p>This practice was once common enough everywhere, and amongst
the ignorant and illiterate in some parts it is still held to be
a perfectly legitimate transaction.&nbsp; From the &ldquo;Annual
Register&rdquo; this local instance has been clipped:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Three men and three women went to the Bell
Inn, Edgbaston Street, Birmingham, and made the following
singular entry in the toll book which is kept there: August 31,
1773, Samuel Whitehouse, of the Parish of Willenhall, in the
county of Stafford, this day sold his wife, Mary Whitehouse, in
open market, to Thomas Griffiths, of Birmingham, value one
shilling.&nbsp; To take her with all her faults.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&nbsp;(Signed) Samuel Whitehouse.<br
/>
Mary Whitehouse.</p>
<p>Voucher, Thomas Buckley, of Birmingham.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The parties were all exceedingly well pleased, and the money
paid down for the toll as for a regular purchase.</p>
<p>So much for the moral status of the people; now to consider
them from the industrial side.</p>
<p>The older generation of Willenhall men were accustomed, ere
factory Acts and kindred forms of parental legislation had
regulated working hours and otherwise ameliorated the conditions
of labour, to slave for many weary hours in little domiciliary
workshops.&nbsp; Boys were then apprenticed at a tender age, and
soon <!-- page 188--><a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>became humpbacked in consequence of
throwing in the weight of their little bodies in the endeavour to
eke out the strength of the feeble thews and bones in their
immature arms.</p>
<p>In those days men worked when they liked, and played when it
suited them; they generally played the earlier days of the week,
even if at the end they worked night and day in the attempt to
average the weekly earnings.&nbsp; In this connection it has been
suggested that in pre-Reformation times Willenhall folk duly
honoured St. Sunday and well as St. Monday, consecrating both
days to the sacred cause of weekly idleness.&nbsp; Or was
Willenhall&rsquo;s Holy Well dedicated to St. Dominic, and came
by grammatical error to be called St. Sunday?&nbsp; As
thus&mdash;Sanctus Dominicus abbreviated first to Sanc. Dominic,
and then extended in the wrong gender to Sancta Dominica,
otherwise Saint Sunday?&nbsp; Who shall say?&nbsp; It may have
been so.</p>
<p>It is perhaps in their pleasures, more than in their pursuits,
that the character of a people is to be best seen.&nbsp; Allusion
has been made to the obsolete Trinity Fair in Chapter XII.; but
the Wake has remained to this day, less loyally observed perhaps,
but rich in traditions of past glories.</p>
<p>Willenhall Wake falls on the first Sunday after September
11th, the Feast of St. Giles, to whom the old church is
dedicated.</p>
<p>Among the wakes of the Black Country none are richer in
reminiscence of the old time forms of festivity than that of
Willenhall.&nbsp; Although in later times the outward and visible
sign of its celebration has dwindled down to an assemblage of
shows and roundabouts, shooting galleries, and ginger-bread
stalls, it was once accompanied by bull-baitings and
cock-fighting, and all the other coarse and brutal sports in
which our forefathers so much delighted.</p>
<blockquote><p>At Wednesfield at one village wake<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cockers all did meet<br />
At Billy Lane&rsquo;s, the cock-fighter&rsquo;s,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To have a sporting treat.</p>
<p>For Charley Marson&rsquo;s spangled cock<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was matched to fight a red<br />
That came from Will&rsquo;n&rsquo;all o&rsquo;er the fields,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And belonged to &ldquo;Cheeky Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 189--><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>Two finer birds in any cock-pit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Two never yet was seen.<br />
Though the Wednesfield men declared<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their cock was sure to win.</p>
<p>The cocks fought well, and feathers fled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All round about the pit,<br />
While blood from both of &rsquo;em did flow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet ne&rsquo;er un would submit.</p>
<p>At last the spangled Wedgefield bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Began to show defeat,<br />
When Billy Lane, he up and swore<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird shouldn&rsquo;t be beat;</p>
<p>For he would fight the biggest mon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That came from Will&rsquo;n&rsquo;all town,<br />
When on the word, old &ldquo;Cheeky Ned&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Got up and knocked him down.</p>
<p>To fight they went like bull-dogs,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As it is very well known,<br />
Till &ldquo;Cheeky Ned&rdquo; seized Billy&rsquo;s thumb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And bit it to the bone.</p>
<p>At this the Wednesfield men begun<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their comrade&rsquo;s part to take,<br />
And never was a fiercer fight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fought at a village wake.</p>
<p>They beat the men from Will&rsquo;n&rsquo;all town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Back to their town again,<br />
And long they will remember<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This Wednesfield wake and main.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The site of the Willenhall Bull Ring, it may be added for the
information of future generations, was opposite the Baptist
Chapel, Little London, where Temple Bar joins the Wednesfield and
Bloxwich Roads.</p>
<p>Among other Wake observances of the last century were the
&ldquo;Club Walkings&rdquo; or processioning of the Friendly
Societies, whose members first attended a brief service in the
church, and then spent the rest of the day in feasting at the
Neptune Inn opposite.&nbsp; Tradition hath it that further back,
well into the Georgian era, and certainly before Mr.
Fisher&rsquo;s time, another Wake custom was that of
&ldquo;kissing the parson,&rdquo; a privilege of which the women
were said to be very jealous.</p>
<p>In the year 1857 the Right Hon. C. P. Villiers, Member of
Parliament for the Borough of Wolverhampton, of which this
township was part, inaugurated in Willenhall one of the first
exhibitions of fine art and industry ever held in the Black
Country.&nbsp; <!-- page 190--><a name="page190"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 190</span>It was opened on the Monday in the
Wake week, and Mr. Villiers alluded to the fact that &ldquo;they
met in the midst of one of those old-fashioned wakes which it was
the humour of their ancestors to establish and be pleased
with,&rdquo; and the right hon. gentleman proceeded to contrast
the present with the past conditions of Willenhall Wake-time.</p>
<p>A flourishing Free Library&mdash;founded like many another in
the face of great local opposition and prejudice&mdash;is one of
the legacies of that exhibition, from the date of which may be
traced the more rational observance of Wake-time.</p>
<p>With the advance of science and art and the spread of popular
education, the future prosperity of an ingenious community, like
that of the skilled mechanics and deft craftsmen of this
township, is assured.&nbsp; Impressed with such certitude it is
all but a work of supererogation to echo the patriotic sentiment
of the old-time townsfolk&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;LET WILLENHALL
FLOURISH!&rdquo;</p>

class="footnote">[88]</a>&nbsp; Claudy Phillips, as he was
popularly called, seems to have been a man of considerable
genius, though not without some of the eccentricities which
sometimes accompany it.&nbsp; He was well known throughout the
county, which he used to traverse dressed at one time in laced
clothes, at others in garments which betrayed the low state of
his exchequer.&nbsp; When drawn to it by stress of financial
embarassment, he was not above playing in the evening at inns,
and throwing himself upon the generosity of his audiences
there.&nbsp; As to his qualities as a musician, it is said his
<i>forte</i> was in wild and plaintive melody, dictated by the
impulses of his own mind, and subject to none of the ordinary
rules of studied compositions; his manipulation of the violin was
also distinguished for a rapidity of execution unrivalled in
those days.&nbsp; The handsome marble tablet erected to his
memory soon after his death, in 1732, by public subscription,
shows that he must have been held in considerable estimation by a
goodly number of admirers.&nbsp; Indeed, he must have been known
to some of the most prominent personages of his time, as the
following lines upon him have been variously attributed to Dr.
Johnson or to David Garrick:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Phillips, whose touch harmonious could remove<br
/>
The pangs of guilty power and hapless love,<br />
Rest here! distrest by poverty no more,<br />
Here find that calm thou gav&rsquo;st so oft before!<br />
Sleep undisturbed within this peaceful shrine,<br />
Till angels wake thee with a note like thine!</p>

set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
